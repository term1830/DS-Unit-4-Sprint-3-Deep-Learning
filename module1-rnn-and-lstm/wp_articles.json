{"article":{"0":"Contributing columnist\n\nThe House is on fire. And with each passing day, Donald Trump defiles the office of the president. If only past defrocked presidents could provide a roadmap for this firestorm.\n\nAndrew Johnson fought impeachment vigorously and survived removal, but never won reelection. Richard Nixon got in the way of justice, but eventually bowed to the rule of law, accepting his asterisk in the annals of history and resigning before certain removal. Bill Clinton expressed contrition, went on to complete his presidency with high approval ratings and has remained a popular former president.\n\nIf you care about democracy, the rule of law and nearly 250 years of constitutional governance, take heed. President Trump is no Clinton or Nixon, or even Johnson. He will not go quietly. It will be ugly. He will betray us and the rule of law in the process \u2014 defying subpoenas, withholding documents, blocking witnesses.\n\nThis presidency is fouled with disrespect for rules, boundaries and norms. Trump walked away from major agreements negotiated by his predecessors \u2014 the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accord \u2014 and the United States\u2019 word as bond is no more. Look at the ease with which he discards supporters \u2014 ask former attorney general Jeff Sessions or former secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Ask our allies, here today, gone tomorrow \u2014 NATO, the Kurds in Syria.\n\nFrom his earliest days as a candidate, Trump voiced appallingly arrogant views about the power of the presidency: \u201cMexico will pay for the wall!\u201d ; \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d; \u201cMy primary consultant is myself.\u201d His possessiveness over people and institutions is also not new: \u201cmy generals and my military,\u201d \u201cmy African American.\u201d\n\nOnly months into his presidency, Trump disparaged democratic allies, including Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel (\u201cruining Germany\u201d) and Britain\u2019s Theresa May (\u201cfoolish\u201d) \u2014 notably, both women \u2014 in favor of strong-arm leaders such as North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un (who wrote him \u201cbeautiful letters\u201d), Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman (\u201cvery good ally\u201d), Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan (\u201cgreat friendship\u201d) and the Philippines\u2019 Rodrigo Duterte (\u201cgreat relationship\u201d). Trump heaps praise on Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin (\u201che\u2019s a strong leader\u201d). And, days after revealing his words pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on his opponent, he invited China to do it, too.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign for the White House was rotten from the beginning. We glimpsed its depths when his lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance felonies and identified Trump as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in a conspiracy to pay off an adult-film star and a former Playboy model to silence them during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign. We got even more evidence of Trump\u2019s deception in the dense report prepared by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election to benefit Trump and try to defeat Hillary Clinton. Mueller laid the groundwork for at least 10 acts of obstruction of justice.\n\nEven with all of that, it\u2019s this still-unraveling Ukraine story that makes clear the bits and pieces that we could only imagine with Trump\u2019s pleas to \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening . . . .\u201d We have the same threats, lies, subterfuge and obstruction \u2014 only this time, we have the president\u2019s unambiguous words to Zelensky: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d Ukraine represents the same lawlessness that propelled Trump over the finish line in 2016: this time in plain sight, with witnesses, including at least one whistleblower and lots of bit players. From the State Department to the Energy Department to the Justice Department and throughout the White House, Trump is using every bit of the machinery of government and personnel at his disposal to strongarm a small country under the heel of its threatening Russian neighbor \u2014 all to get manufactured dirt on a political opponent.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal. The evidence is bearing fruit. The time will come. And justice will be served.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal approval rating remains low, though stable, but there is growing support for impeachment \u2014 a Fox News poll this week found that 51 percent support removing Trump from office. Independents, as well as Democrats, mostly support the impeachment inquiry, while Republicans are mostly holding tight. These things may or may not change.\n\nEither way, we will be changed if we do not right this ship of democracy.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.\u201d We should heed these words, spoken by the 1999 version of Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The fire did not start with Ukraine. Nonetheless, Ukraine may give us the water to finally put it out.\n\nRead more from Donna F. Edwards's archive.","1":"When President Trump announced his decision to pull troops from northern Syria, his critics immediately warned that the move would pave the way for a Turkish offensive with potentially catastrophic repercussions.\n\nState Department officials swiftly denied that Trump supported the Turkish incursion. Meanwhile, Trump appeared convinced that he had made the right choice.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThey now indeed are, but not to the advantage of the United States.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the U.S. has shot itself into the foot,\u201d said Ali Fathollah-Nejad, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center.\n\nWho are likely winners?\n\nThe U.S. pullout has enabled Turkey to pursue its military incursion without having to fear U.S. interference, but it has also created opportunities for four of the United States\u2019 key foes: Iran, the Assad regime, Russia and \u2014 potentially \u2014 the Islamic State group.\n\nWho is set to lose most?\n\nThe biggest losers \u2014 it appears at this stage \u2014 are the allies who fought alongside U.S. soldiers in Syria: Europe and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nThe former are afraid that the move will free Islamic State prisoners held in Kurdish prisons and camps and expose Europe to new militant attacks after a period of relative calm. The latter had established a de facto state in the north of Syria over the last years \u2014 in large parts in places previously ruled by the Islamic State. The Kurds hoped that their territory was somewhat protected by a U.S. military presence that acted as a deterrent.\n\nHow did we get to this point?\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long viewed the Kurdish-held territory in Syria as a safe haven for the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK \u2014 whom Erdogan considers to be a terrorist group.\n\nMeanwhile, to the south of the Kurdish-held territories, Russia and Iran-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been waiting for an opportunity to seize back the cities and swaths of land he lost during the war.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement of a pullout one week ago offered an opening for both Erdogan and Assad. On Wednesday, Turkish troops began their offensive at multiple points along the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish artillery fire on the Kurds, a mass exodus of civilians and apparent footage of roadside executions of Kurdish fighters soon followed. Hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped detention, according to Kurdish officials.\n\nWithout U.S. backing and amid mounting chaos, the Kurds appeared to face the choice between a deadly confrontation with the militarily superior Turkish forces \u2014 or a deal with the Assad regime.\n\nBy Sunday, the SDF had opted for the second option: They announced a deal with the Syrian government to allow forces loyal to the regime to enter its territory. By Monday, Syrian government troops were raising flags in the towns close to the Turkish-Syrian border in a move that could make the presence of the remaining U.S. troops in the region unsustainable.\n\nHow do the Assad regime, Russia and Iran benefit?\n\nWith the United States voluntarily giving up much of its leverage in Syria, Russia has likely the most to gain. Throughout the Syrian civil war, Russia has staunchly supported the Assad regime. Over the weekend, the New York Times revealed that the Russian Air Force deliberately and repeatedly bombed Syrian hospitals in rebel-held areas, indicating how far Russia is willing to go to support Assad.\n\nBut apart from military force, Russian President Vladimir Putin has also pushed ahead with diplomatic initiatives, positioning him at the center of the Syrian morass. The U.S. pullout expands the Russian leverage in at least two ways.\n\nFirstly, the strengthening of the Assad regime would inevitably also bolster Russia, a key backer.\n\nBut ironically, it could also help to deepen Moscow\u2019s ties to the country Assad\u2019s forces may now face off in northern Syria: Turkey. With the United States potentially poised to impose sanctions on Turkey, as Trump indicated Monday, Russia\u2019s rapprochement with Turkey could speed up \u2014 despite the countries\u2019 differing interests in Syria.\n\nFrom Russia\u2019s perspective, this apparent contradiction may not seem so contradictory at all. In the past, Moscow has argued that SDF fighters should yield control to the Assad regime. The Turkish incursion and U.S. pullout may lead to exactly such a scenario, as Sunday\u2019s deal between the SDF and the Assad regime appeared to suggest.\n\nThe developments of the last week may also be an opportunity for Iran, another backer of the Assad regime. The U.S. pullout, said Brookings researcher Fathollah-Nejad, \u201cwill expand Iran\u2019s opportunities to engage with Kurds and portray itself as the only reliable partner.\u201d This could help Tehran restrict the Kurds\u2019 drive for empowerment, which Iran opposes.\n\nBut Fathollah-Nejad cautioned that Russia\u2019s and Iran\u2019s interests in Syria were not necessarily aligned and that the Turkish incursion may still end up becoming a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for Iran, which explains why Iranian officials have officially condemned the Turkish offensive.\n\nIranian officials may fear a radicalization of Kurdish separatism, said Fathollah-Nejad, and a full-blown resurgence of the Islamic State.\n\nHow does Islamic State gain?\n\nAmid the backlash against his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, Trump went on the offensive last week and blamed European countries for what he suggested was a lack of willingness to take back Islamic State fighters born in Europe and held by the Syrian Kurds.\n\n\u201cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost,\u201d Trump reiterated on Monday.\n\nEuropean officials have rejected Trump\u2019s criticism, arguing that Islamic State returnees would in many cases walk free in Europe, as authorities often lack evidence for crimes committed in Syria or Iraq. Despite fierce criticism from human rights advocates, major European governments have opted to leave Islamic State fighters in Kurdish detention.\n\nThe U.S. pullout has now resulted in an outcome detrimental both to U.S. counterterrorism officials and their European counterparts. Some 785 people affiliated with the Islamic State escaped from a camp on Sunday, according to Kurdish officials.\n\nApart from the escape of former Islamic State fighters or supporters, European officials worry that the chaos of renewed widespread military conflict in that part of Syria could provide the Islamic State group with an opening to conduct new attacks and rebuild its organization.\n\nRead more:\n\nSyrian troops enter towns in northeast as Erdogan warns of wider offensive\n\nAs Trump withdraws U.S. forces from northern Syria, his administration scrambles to respond\n\nUnswayed by top advisers, Trump doubles down on decision to withdraw troops","2":"Nature teases us today with some flirtatious showers that continue to play hard-to-get.

(iStock)\n\nColumnist\n\nIf you\u2019re covered under Medicare, don\u2019t let complacency prevent you from reviewing your health insurance options and maybe saving some money.\n\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7. It is during this period that those covered by Medicare \u2014 people 65 and older \u2014 can change their health plan and prescription drug coverage for 2020.\n\nFor many people, the Medicare open-enrollment process can be confusing with its alphabet plans. Part A is hospital insurance, Part B is medical insurance, Part C is Medicare Advantage (offered by private companies approved by Medicare such as an HMO) and Part D is prescription drug coverage. Even if you\u2019ve been happy with your coverage, open enrollment is the time to double check what you have and make changes.\n\n[It's a good deal for most older Americans but Medicare is neither free nor easy]\n\nYou should have received your \u201cPlan Annual Notice of Change,\u201d which lists any changes in your plan, such as a possible increase in cost or coverage areas. It\u2019s important that you review this document. The notice will compare the benefits in 2020 with those you\u2019re currently receiving. Be sure to check your prescription drug plan to ensure that the medications you need will still be covered. If a drug you take is no longer covered, you may want to switch plans. If you didn\u2019t get your notice, which should have been mailed last month, contact your plan.\n\nTo help you review your options, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have redesigned the \u201cMedicare Plan Finder\u201d on medicare.gov\n\nMedicare\u2019s Plan Finder makes it easier to compare coverage options and shop for plans.\n\nWe\u2019ve just updated the Medicare Plan Finder with 2020 \u2b50 ratings for #Medicare health & drug plans. Star ratings help you compare the quality of health & drug plans as you review coverage options during #MedicareOE, which starts Tuesday, Oct. 15. https:\/\/t.co\/ttRZpQVVtr pic.twitter.com\/6n1eSLonRn \u2014 Medicare.gov (@MedicareGov) October 11, 2019\n\nIn reviewing your plan, don\u2019t just focus on prices. You should balance affordability with coverage, making sure your plan provides the health services you need.\n\nThe nonprofit Medicare Rights Center has put together a free online reference tool that can help walk you thorough your choices. The consumer service organization also pointed out some updates for 2020:\n\n\u2014 This year, Medicare Advantage Plans were allowed more flexibility in offering certain benefits such as nutrition services or in-home supports, and home modifications. In 2020, plans are allowed to offer more services to certain members with chronic conditions.\n\n\u2014 The average Medicare prescription drug plan premium for 2020 is down slightly to $32.74 per month from $33.19.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) addresses some common questions in its Medicare open enrollment FAQs section. For example, here are a few questions answered by KFF.\n\n\u201cQ: My husband and I are retired. He just turned 65 and is covered under Medicare, but I am 62 and don\u2019t have health insurance. As the spouse of a Medicare beneficiary, can I enroll in Medicare during the open enrollment period?\n\n\u201cKFF: No. Although your husband now qualifies for Medicare, you will not qualify for Medicare until you turn age 65. If you do not have health insurance now, you can consider signing up for health insurance coverage through a Marketplace plan\n\n\u201cQ: I didn\u2019t sign up for Part B when I first became eligible, but want to sign up now. I know there is a penalty for late enrollment. Is there any way to avoid the penalty?\n\n\u201cKFF: Generally, no. In most cases, if you missed your Part B enrollment window, which runs from the three months before the month of your 65th birthday through the three months after the month of your 65th birthday, you will face a late enrollment penalty once you do enroll, which will be added to your premium costs for the remainder of your enrollment. The penalty equals 10 percent of the standard monthly premium for each 12-month period that you delayed enrollment.\n\n\u201cIf you did not enroll for Part B during your initial enrollment period, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to sign up for Part B (and\/or Part A) anytime as long as you or a spouse is working and you\u2019re covered by a group health plan through that employment. For people age 65 or over who have coverage through a group health plan, there is also an 8-month SEP, which starts the month after the employment ends, or the group health plan coverage ends. If you sign up during an SEP, the late enrollment penalty will not apply.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the late penalty for Part B click here.\n\nFor more information on the late penalty for Part D click here.\n\nIf you need help with Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or go to Medicare.gov.\n\nRead more:\n\nDon\u2019t get paralyzed by open enrollment \u2014 just do it\n\nGetting the most out of Medicare\n\nYour Thoughts\n\nDo you review your plan during Medicare open enrollment?

This is a worldwide epidemic everyone knows about yet simply accepts (an understandable dilemma if resolving may require an earlier start to the day).\n\nOver the years, dozens of solutions have surfaced to get people out of bed in a timely fashion. (Not the least of which, of course, is to just go to sleep earlier to give your body the rest it needs \u2014 but surely we can devise a solution more complicated than that!)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is the old trick of putting your alarm clock on the other side of the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. Leveling up from that is \u201cClocky,\u201d a clever little alarm clock that jumps off your nightstand and runs away and hides while its alarm rings. And, perhaps to take the cake, the \u201cHigh Voltage Ejector Bed\u201d literally catapults its sleeper out of bed in the morning.\n\nSo with all of these action-based product solutions, why does this issue still persist?\n\nIt is because we are developing solutions that force ourselves up in the mornings rather than solutions that make us want to get up. We are willingly beginning our days with self-inflicted cruelty instead of trying to create an environment where it feels natural and comfortable to wake up early.\n\nAD\n\nProduct solutions punish our lack of self-discipline by harassing us into doing something we do not want to do. Many designs fall short of resolving the bigger picture problem and just act, instead, as negative additives to our daily routine. There are better solutions than this, though: Instead of looking at product design, we can turn to the design of our environment for solutions.\n\nAD\n\nSensory design is the strategy in architecture of designing spaces to appeal to multiple human senses (sight, sound, scent, taste, touch).\n\nThe most successful, holistic designs are those that engage more than one sense: These spaces create the best experience and become the most memorable. Restaurants do this all the time: It is about more than just the food (and lack of cleanup); it is about the dining experience. Delicious aromas wafting by on trays, background music to set the mood, a velvety glass of red wine to start the meal \u2026 restaurants stimulate as many senses as they can to create a memorable experience. It is called creating \u201cambiance.\u201d (And the same can be applied to any dinner party you host \u2014 ambiance through sensory design will surely make a more memorable experience than silence and a sandwich tray!)\n\nAD\n\nRestaurants aside, most of our architecture \u2014 homes, offices, retail, etc. \u2014 is designed primarily and almost exclusively for visual engagement, though. Those scents, tastes and sounds are all stripped down to leave us with a far less rich experience, even if the visuals are extremely interesting.\n\nAD\n\nThink of closing your eyes in a large building. How would you navigate without sight? You would become reliant on your other senses: Maybe the texture of the flooring beneath your feet changes from one area to another area. Perhaps the bathrooms have lilies outside of them, giving off a light floral scent whenever you pass. What if you know you are passing a cafe by the music you hear playing?\n\nThese multisensory clues \u2014 even if you are using all five senses \u2014 create intuitive guidance, or \u201cwayfinding,\u201d which can influence behavior like how easily\/successfully you navigate a space. That is the key: We are more inclined to \u201cgo with the flow\u201d or do something if it is intuitive and feels natural, and sensory design is a great way to design for intuitive spaces.\n\nAD\n\nThis is a great strategy utilized by professional designers erecting new commercial buildings, but it is also a strategy that anyone outside of the industry can apply in the design of their own spaces in everyday life. Sensory design can be an excellent strategy for thinking of out-of-the-box solutions, especially where other solutions have failed to address environmental considerations.\n\nAD\n\nHere are a few ways to think about incorporating sensory design into your home:\n\n\u00b7 Scent is an underrated sense: It often goes unnoticed until an odor comes along, then all we want is to cut off our sense of smell. Yet this is still a characteristic of any home, so think about design features that will define the scent of your home to your liking.\n\nAD\n\nConsider what kind of ambiance you want in each room, then match a scent to it. Lavender might match a fresh and clean bathroom, vanilla may be cozy for the living room, sandalwood could be good for a relaxing bedroom.\n\nThese can be achieved by decor additives like live plants, reed diffusers, potpourri, candles (even unlit ones can be effective in smaller spaces) or even scented cleaning products (but all can be overcome if you do not have good ventilation in your kitchen and you frequently cook). Also remember that surfaces that trap dust, dirt and debris trap and harbor odors, too, so be selective on where you place those absorptive, harder-to-clean surfaces, like carpeting or even some decor.\n\nAD\n\n\u00b7 Flooring is an easy way to reevaluate your home environment using sensory design. For any given room, a flooring type is usually selected for its ease of cleaning and visual appeal, but different flooring materials have different acoustic properties, too.\n\nAD\n\nSound will bounce off hard flooring like wood, tile or concrete and \u2014 in open floor plans \u2014 can even echo. Carpet, on the other hand, absorbs sound (the kind of furniture you have in a room \u2014 like all hard wood vs. all soft fabric \u2014 can also affect how much or little sound bounces around a space).\n\nAdditionally, consider how each flooring feels under your feet: Soft carpet is a different texture and communicates a different kind of space than cold tile. With a cohesive color palette, having a variety of flooring in your home can be a great way to denote the transition from one kind of space to another \u2014 or even communicate the continuation of a space, rather than the separation. This is often why you see the flooring in kitchens continued underneath the breakfast nook or dining room. The continuous flooring indicates that, despite multiple elements in a space, everything is connected and considered in the same \u201czone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u00b7 Doorbells are usually connected to a small speaker inside a house so you can hear when someone is ringing outside. However, \u201csmart\u201d doorbells that connect to your phone now buzz in your pocket or flash the screen at you to indicate someone is at the door. This is an excellent example of utilizing a multisensory home design element because if one of your senses is occupied \u2014 for instance, if you have headphones on blasting music \u2014 you will still get the alert and can greet your guests or retrieve your packages.\n\nAD\n\nSensory design can intuitively make a space more memorable and change how you interact with your environment.\n\nSo, back to our problem: How can we use sensory design to make the environment work better for us and make getting out of bed \u201cintuitive\u201d in the morning?\n\nLet us assess. Alarm clocks are primarily auditory. How else can we break down this problem, and what other senses can we engage?\n\nAD\n\nConsider how the cooler the temperature is, and the more cocooned into snugly blankets we are, the less appealing the venture out into the rest of the room is.\n\nWhat happens when the rest of the room is cozy and warm, too, though? What if it actually makes being under the blankets even slightly warmer than we prefer?\n\nAD\n\nMost likely, your body will naturally decide it would rather change environments, or simply not require the cozy bed to be ideally comfortable anymore. Before you know it, using a sensory design approach, you could be up and out of bed without a single hit of the snooze button.\n\nWith a quick reprogramming of the thermostat, or a space heater on a timer in the colder months, you can schedule the temperature to rise \u2014 just a few degrees \u2014 aligned with the timing of your alarm clock. Taking this multisensory approach by engaging auditory and thermal comfort (\u201ctouch\u201d) cues, instead of just the former, will design a more successful environment to motivate you to get out \u2014 and stay out \u2014 of bed. Then draw the blinds (daylighting\/sight), turn on the coffee (olfactory, or scent) and eat breakfast (taste) to get you well on your way!\n\nAD\n\nThere are infinite tips, tricks and products to help people overcome problems and improve daily life. We are still challenged, though, because often people are the roots of their own problems \u2014 and that can be hard to change. But, as they say, we are all products of our environment. So rather than consciously trying to force a habit that just will not stick \u2014 like getting up on time in the morning \u2014 consider focusing on changing the environment to influence behavior for the better.","5":"From one perspective, this rental property is owned by a company you own: a limited liability company (LLC). Over the years, this LLC received income from rent and paid your expenses on the property. At the end of each year, the LLC had a profit or loss, and the LLC's business is owning the rental property.\n\nIt's generally hard for a homeowner to claim a property owned in an LLC as a primary residence for real estate tax purposes, if you live in a state where there are real estate taxes. With a few exceptions, it's also hard to claim the home is your primary residence on your federal income taxes while the property is owned in an LLC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTransferring the property out of the LLC could pose problems. From a local law perspective, that transfer in some states could trigger the payment of real estate transfer taxes and a reassessment or reevaluation of the property, causing the real estate taxes to go up substantially.\n\nThen there are the federal income tax consequences. Many people who own property in an LLC report any gains or losses from the ownership of a rental property on their personal tax return. Professionals in the industry describe this as the LLC being a \u201cdisregarded entity.\u201d If you file a separate tax return for your LLC and it\u2019s not a disregarded entity, the transfer of ownership from the LLC to you may be considered a sale of the LLC and you\u2019d have capital gains and other taxes to pay from the transfer.\n\nThe best case scenario is that you own the property in the LLC, for federal income tax purposes, and the LLC is a disregarded entity; the transfer of the property from the LLC to your name would not trigger any real estate transfer taxes or cause the local taxing authorities to raise your taxes. If this is all true, then we get to the fun part. You now own the property in your own name. You would no longer be able to depreciate the property and you might be limited in the deductibility of real estate taxes, but you'd own it in your name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou might not notice much difference owning it in your own name, but when it's time to sell the property, the differences will be huge. If this property had always been your primary residence or even a second residence but not a rental property, and you lived in it for two out of the last five years, you'd be entitled to keep your profits from the sale of the home without paying any federal income taxes on those profits. If you're single, you can exclude up to $250,000 of profits from federal income taxes, and if you are married, you and your spouse could exclude up to $500,000 from federal income taxes.\n\nKeep in mind, there are other requirements. So, if you had a profit of $200,000 on the sale, you\u2019d get to keep the money and pay no federal income taxes on the sale.\n\nBut because you once owned the property in an LLC, as a rental property, you won't get the full benefit of the home sale exclusion. Uncle Sam will want you to pay taxes on the sale to recapture the depreciation you took when the property was a rental.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDepending on a variety of factors, the IRS could say that you owned the home for eight out of 10 years as a rental property, and the IRS may claim that you owe tax on 80 percent of the profits and could use the home sale exclusion for the other 20 percent. So, the longer you own the property as a primary residence, the more benefit you'd get from the home sale exclusion.\n\nSo this leads us back to where we started.

By starting the y-axis at 34 percent, small differences can be exaggerated. (Alberto Cairo\/How Charts Lie)\n\nAlberto Cairo wants to make you smarter about charts.\n\nHe\u2019s a professor of visual journalism at the University of Miami, and his third book, \u201cHow Charts Lie,\u201d is geared toward helping people make better sense of the charts, maps and other data visualizations that flood our social media feeds and nightly newscasts.\n\nIn the current political environment, he notes in the book, misinformation is everywhere. A slick chart can add a veneer of authority to shoddy or misleading data, he said, so he made it his goal to help readers avoid the common interpretive pitfalls that took him years to figure out for himself.\n\nEarlier this month I spoke with Cairo about the book, his background and some of the misleading viral visuals he\u2019s come across recently. The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTell me a bit about your background, like how you ended up in this field?\n\nI studied journalism, originally with the goal of working in radio (I love listening to the radio and podcasts). However, I\u2019ve always been in love with visual communication. My dad taught me how to draw a bit, and I read comic books and science books with tons of cutaway illustrations and visual explainers when I was a kid.\n\nI guess I absorbed all that and, in the last year of my B.A., a professor of mine who knew that I can sketch stuff up recommended me to be an intern in the infographics department at the local newspaper of the city where I was born, La Coru\u00f1a, in Spain. The newspaper is La Voz de Galicia. After that, it was just a matter of practicing, learning, studying, making mistakes and trying to learn from them.\n\nWho is this book for? What audience did you have in mind when you wrote it?\n\nI wrote the book with different \u201cpersonas\u201d in mind, to use the parlance common in design research. For instance, my dad and my mom. They are both educated professionals (a medical doctor and the head of nursing in several hospitals, both retired).\n\nMy dad and my mom both know a bit about numbers, but I observed in people like them (and even myself, I admit), the tendency to take charts, maps and graphs at face value, assuming that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words,\u201d a myth I warn against in the book.\n\nFor some reason many people assume that numbers and, as an extension of numbers, the graphics that represent them, are \u201cobjective\u201d and carry truth. The goal of the book is to disabuse people of this intuition. Sure, visualizations are amazing and they can open your eyes to insights you hadn\u2019t noticed before (and I exemplify that in the book), but they need to be approached carefully as written text or speech.\n\nWhy write this book now? Have you been noticing a lot of misinformation, or maybe misinterpretation, among the public on this visual stuff?\n\nVisual misinformation has always been something that has worried me. I addressed it in previous books. However, I\u2019ve noticed an increase in the past few years in countries I\u2019ve lived in: Spain, Brazil, and the U.S. I noticed that governments, companies and individuals have become more adept at designing misleading charts.\n\nJust see this example from yesterday:\n\n\u201cReal median household income\u2014the amount earned by those in the very middle\u2014hit $65,084 for the 12 months ending in July. That\u2019s the highest level ever and a gain of $4,144, or 6.8%, since Mr. Trump took office.\u201d @WSJ pic.twitter.com\/Sna9DHbnyV \u2014 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nNotice the absurd trend line during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nSo, walk me through this \u2014 what\u2019s happening in this chart? What\u2019s misleading about it?\n\nIf we want to have an informed conversation about economic development, wages, jobs, et cetera, we need to consider not just the quantitative realities, but also the qualitative ones: What hides behind the slump at the beginning of [Barack] Obama\u2019s presidency and the recovery at its end? The biggest economic crisis since the Depression.\n\nThat\u2019s why the curve is so steep. Tracing a trend line between one point at its beginning and the end of the presidency is absurd just because that line doesn\u2019t describe at all the realities behind the data. Moreover, the growth during [Donald] Trump\u2019s presidency is simply an extension of trends that were existing before: You can see that if we trace a trend line since 2010 up to the present.\n\nThis is not to diminish more recent growth. The fact that the economy has continued improving steadily, that employment has gone up, that wages have continued increasing \u2026 that\u2019s great news on its own. But it\u2019s not something that began in November 2016 or January 2017. It\u2019s an inherited situation.\n\nOne thing that struck me about this chart is it appears to be from the Wall Street Journal? So you have to assume that their intention wasn\u2019t to lead folks astray here, but it ended up happening anyway?\n\nExactly! And that\u2019s a point in the book, which contains mostly charts that were NOT designed in purpose to mislead anyone but that are at risk to be misread, particularly if they are related to deeply held ideological beliefs. As I wrote, charts often lie because we are all prone to lying to ourselves.\n\nThe good news is that I believe that we can curb this impulse a bit if we are more informed and more careful, and that\u2019s what I try to teach in the book. And I\u2019d add: even teaching to MYSELF, as most of the mistakes when reading charts that I describe in the book are mistakes I have made myself.\n\nSo this kind of segues into my next question: the title is how charts lie, which is a great title. But like, who is doing the lying, exactly?\n\nA more accurate title would have been How Charts Mislead, Deceive, and Lie, How We Lie to Ourselves With Them, How We Can Avoid That Happening, and How We Can Use Charts Instead to Inform Meaningful Conversations About Urgent Issues. But nobody would buy a book like that!\n\n\n\nOne of the more egregious examples of a lying chart, left, was shared by Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz in a 2015 congressional hearing. The lines were drawn to different scales, falsely implying that Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than cancer screenings. Cairo redrew the chart, right, using a proper scale. (Alberto Cairo\/How Charts Lie)\n\nBut yes, charts do lie. Because reading a chart is not something that happens in the chart itself. It happens in the interface between the visual object AND your brain. And our brains are very prone to seeing what is not really there, to project onto charts what we already believe, to read beyond what the chart is showing (that\u2019s why I came up with the mantra: \u201ca chart shows only what it shows and nothing else.\u201d Everything else that you see in a chart is often in your brain, not in the chart).\n\nHow do you generally recommend people approach charts, like the \u201cshocking\u201d or \u201cstunning\u201d viral charts they may see on their social feeds? What would you want a person who\u2019s considering sharing a chart like this to do?\n\nThe Sagan Standard is timeless: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The more striking, shocking or stunning a chart is, the higher our scrutiny of it should be. In the book, I describe things to look into when facing any chart: checking the source of its data (if a chart doesn\u2019t mention the source, ignore it, period); also, if you have a minute, visit the source itself to see whether the chart is measuring what it claims to be measuring. In one of my previous books, I have this example of several sources of worldwide data on intrafamily violence against women reporting hugely different rates for the same countries. Why? Because they defined \u201cviolence\u201d in different ways. In the case of the source reporting lower rates, they were only counting physical violence; in the case of the source with higher rates, they also counted verbal violence, and other forms.\n\nAfter assessing what the chart is truly measuring and showing, we need to pay attention to how the information is displayed: Is the chart or map distorting the data, maybe to emphasize points that favor the author\u2019s opinions or agendas? Have the axis of a graph been cropped to exaggerate or minimize differences or variations?\n\nThe most important point, though, is to remind ourselves that we all project; therefore the mantra \u201ca chart shows only what it shows and nothing else\u201d is a good heuristic. The more the apparent message of a chart aligns with your ideological beliefs, the more you should force yourself to read it carefully, just because we are all prone to liking that chart beforehand and take it at face value. We all tend to do the opposite: scrutinize more closely charts whose message we disagree with. It\u2019s a lot of work, but it\u2019s worth it.","7":"Nature teases us today with some flirtatious showers that continue to play hard-to-get.

Now, in the space of just a few days, his administration is already reaping what it sowed.\n\nTurkey\u2019s incursions at various points along its border with Syria began on Wednesday and, by the weekend, had already plunged the region into chaos. Turkish artillery pounded Syrian Kurdish positions, while footage emerged appearing to show Turkish-affiliated militiamen carrying out grisly roadside executions of Kurdish fighters allied to the United States. Tens of thousands of panicked civilians attempted to flee the Turkish-led advance, raising fears of an eventual exodus into Iraqi Kurdistan, where more than a million people displaced by conflict still live in camps.\n\nTrump, who spent part of the weekend at one of his golf courses, insisted on Twitter that his country ought to be rid of its commitments in the \u201cquicksand\u201d of the Middle East. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\" on Sunday that the United States was now in \u201ca very untenable situation\u201d and would evacuate its roughly 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria entirely.\n\n\u201cThe order to remove troops came Saturday, toward the end of a chaotic day in which the viability of the U.S. mission in Syria rapidly unraveled after Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel proxies advanced deep into Syrian territory and cut U.S. supply lines,\u201d my colleagues reported. It flew in the face of the Pentagon\u2019s assurances last week that the United States would not \u201cabandon\u201d its Syrian Kurdish partners, who have been on the front lines in the war against the Islamic State and borne the brunt of the casualties in a U.S.-led campaign.\n\nBut security headaches have only mushroomed amid American maneuvers to withdraw. Hundreds of Islamic State detainees may have escaped a prison camp run by beleaguered Syrian Kurdish fighters. Separately, in the late hours of Sunday, reports indicated that Syrian regime forces were also converging on areas once guarded by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-led alliance now in Turkey\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nHung out to dry by the United States, the SDF turned to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for protection. A senior Syrian Kurdish politician told Reuters that SDF officials met counterparts in the Assad regime at a Russian air base in Syria to hash out a deal. By Sunday evening, the SDF confirmed that, to repel or stall the Turkish invasion, it had invited the regime into areas it had formerly controlled with U.S. protection.\n\nFor many on the ground, this seemed an inevitable and relatively welcome outcome. \u201cFor the regime to intervene and deploy its forces on the Turkish border is a comforting thought,\u201d a Syrian Kurdish woman, who gave her name as Nowruz, told my colleagues. \u201cIf a deal with the regime is what it takes to stop these massacres, then so be it. At the end of the day, we are all Syrians, and the regime is Syrian, too.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s thinly veiled goal in launching the invasion was to smash Rojava, the name for the autonomous enclave in northeastern Syria carved out by the SDF over the past few years. Ankara views the main Syrian Kurdish faction as a direct outgrowth of the PKK, an outlawed Kurdish separatist group that has fought a bloody decades-long insurgency in Turkey. If northeastern Syria falls back under the security umbrella of Damascus, that may in and of itself be a satisfying outcome for the Turks. Russia\u2019s role in brokering the rapprochement between Assad and the Syrian Kurds after the Turkish invasion may be a sign, analysts suggested, of a tacit Syrian endgame being thrashed out by the Turks and the Russians.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration painted itself as a somewhat helpless bystander. \u201cWe have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies,\u201d Esper told CBS. In his Sunday tweets, Trump seemed to wave away any interest in the battle and reiterated his position that it\u2019s \u201cvery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting\" along the Syrian-Turkish border. This followed reports Friday that Turkish artillery appeared to be firing multiple \u201cbracketing\u201d rounds near positions manned by U.S. Special Forces, an astonishing act by a NATO ally that U.S. officials thought was deliberate.\n\nDo you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nTrump attempted to underscore his point of view with a garbled history lesson, but it only emphasized his lack of genuine engagement with the intricacies of Middle East policy. He brought up a supposed incident in 2017 when \u201cIraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria\u201d and his critics then also urged the United States to stand by their Kurdish allies. But no such event took place. Trump was possibly thinking of the Iraqi government\u2019s seizure of the city of Kirkuk \u2014 in Iraq \u2014 from the control of fighters affiliated with factions based in the semiautonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan.\n\nWhatever the case, some experts argued that the sudden American departure from northeastern Syria was inevitable \u2014 if not the chaotic manner in which it\u2019s being carried out. Trump has been determined for months to pull out U.S. forces. The American support of the SDF \u2014 no matter the great affection for the Syrian Kurdish fighters among U.S. politicians and military officials \u2014 was always in conflict with Washington\u2019s need to keep Turkey on its side.\n\nAt the same time, somewhat in opposition to the president, senior Trump officials steered a policy that let the SDF think it had \u201cindefinite\u201d backing from the United States. They also pursued an ambitious agenda of ending Iranian influence in Syria, a goal that is deeply at odds with Trump\u2019s desire for an exit.\n\n\u201cFor three years we have kidded ourselves about this, and those that pushed policies at odds with Trump, working to sketch out a maximalist policy that ignored Ankara\u2019s obvious intent, and the wishes of the world\u2019s most powerful man, should be ashamed,\" said Aaron Stein, director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, to Al-Monitor.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?

It was an acknowledgment that if the administration isn\u2019t careful and thoughtful in the foreign policy decisions it makes, the result can be disaster.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t look too closely at his desire to avoid another Middle East war, you might think President Trump shared the same view.

Trump\u2019s decision to give Erdogan the green light to invade completely blindsided not just our Kurdish allies but also pretty much everyone in his own government, from the Pentagon to the State Department to Capitol Hill.\n\nThen Trump decided to remove all American forces from the area, and began vacillating back and forth between making bizarre criticisms of the Kurds to justify his decision (\u201cThey didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War. They didn\u2019t help us in Normandy\u201d) and threatening to destroy the Turkish economy to punish Erdogan for the invasion that Trump allowed him to undertake.\n\nReporting from The Post and other news outlets paints a picture of chaos inside the administration, with Trump being criticized vociferously even by Republican supporters and the government scrambling to deal with unfolding events on the ground.

The United States has been caught between Turkey, a NATO ally, and the Kurds, whom we have worked with and supported. But our presence there was helping to prevent a conflagration.

(Alexei Druzhinin\/Sputnik\/Kremlin Pool\/AP)\n\nWith Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Vladimir Putin has won so much these past three years that he may get tired of winning.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community\u2019s January 2017 report on Russian interference in the previous year\u2019s presidential campaign sought to explain why Donald Trump was so attractive to Moscow. This sentence has fresh salience: \u201cPro-Kremlin proxy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, proclaimed just before the election that if [Trump] won, Russia would \u2018drink champagne\u2019 in anticipation of being able to advance its positions on Syria and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nComing on the heels of Trump holding up assistance for Ukraine as his administration urged its new president to investigate a Democratic challenger, Trump\u2019s order on Saturday to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has given the Russians a new reason to reach for the bubbly.\n\nThe American retreat forced our Kurdish allies, outmanned and outgunned by the invading Turks, to turn toward the Kremlin and seek help from Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Damascus that they had spent years fighting to break away from. Syrian government forces, propped up by the Russian military, have long been held in abeyance by the U.S. presence. Now they\u2019re filling the vacuum. Kurdish leaders announced late Sunday that they have invited these troops into towns that have been under their control for years.\n\n\u201cThe announcement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that they had reached an agreement with the Iranian- and Russian-backed government of [Assad] further undermined the prospect of any continued U.S. presence in the country,\u201d Liz Sly, Louisa Loveluck, Asser Khattab and Sarah Dadouch report. \u201cThe deal followed three days of negotiations brokered by Russia between the Syrian government and the SDF, which had reached the conclusion that it could no longer count on the United States, its chief ally for the past five years in the fight against the Islamic State \u2026 It represents a gamble for the Kurds, who appeared to have secured no guarantees for the survival of the autonomy they have secured over the area over the past seven years. \u2026\n\n\u201cBadran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, said the Kurds felt they had no choice but to turn to Damascus in light of what he called the \u2018betrayal\u2019 of the United States. \u2018This has obliged us to look for alternative options,\u2019 he said. \u2026 Residents of northeast Syria said they were stunned by the speed with which SDF defenses appeared to be collapsing \u2026 Hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped a detention camp after Turkish shellfire hit the area, U.S. troops pulled out from another base and Turkish-backed forces consolidated their hold over a vital highway, cutting the main U.S. supply route into Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the Russians and Syrians in there, but obviously we understand why they reached out,\u201d a senior Trump administration official told one of my colleagues. \u201cThis is total chaos,\u201d the official added, \u201ca total s---storm.\u201d\n\nA Turkish-backed fighter fires Sunday during clashes in the border town of Ras al-Ayn as Turkey and its allies continue their assault on Kurdish-held border towns in northeastern Syria.

But if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people. \u2026\n\n\u201cAt Washington\u2019s request, we agreed to withdraw our heavy weapons from the border area with Turkey, destroy our defensive fortifications, and pull back our most seasoned fighters. Turkey would never attack us so long as the U.S. government was true to its word with us. We are now standing with our chests bare to face the Turkish knives,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe know that the United States is not the world police. But we do want the United States to acknowledge its important role in achieving a political solution for Syria. We are sure that Washington has sufficient leverage to mediate a sustainable peace between us and Turkey.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cPutin likely can't believe his luck,\u201d a Western military official from a NATO member country, who recently served in Syria as part of the anti-ISIS coalition, told Business Insider. \u201cA third of Syria was more or less free of ISIS and its security was good without any involvement of the regime or Russia, and now because of the Turkish invasion and American pullout, this area is wide open to return to government control. What was supposed to be a diplomatically complex issue that would have involved U.S. and European military power suddenly got as simple as sending in tanks and units unopposed throughout the eastern third of Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin continues to get whatever he wants and generally doesn't even have to do much,\u201d an unnamed NATO official also told Insider. \u201cHe got to sit back and watch the Turks and the Americans unravel five years of success and not only did it not cost him anything, he didn't even have to try to make it happen. Small wonder he'd interfere on Trump's side in an election.\u201d\n\n-- The Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria to crush the last pockets of resistance to Assad, according to a damning New York Times investigation published on Sunday: \u201cAn analysis of previously unpublished Russian Air Force radio recordings, plane spotter logs and witness accounts allowed The Times to trace bombings of four hospitals in just 12 hours in May and tie Russian pilots to each one. The 12-hour period beginning on May 5 represents a small slice of the air war in Syria, but it is a microcosm of Russia\u2019s four-year military intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. \u2026 Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracks attacks on medical workers in Syria, has documented at least 583 such attacks since 2011, 266 of them since Russia intervened in September 2015. At least 916 medical workers have been killed since 2011. \u2026\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shielded it from scrutiny and made United Nations agencies reluctant to accuse the Russian Air Force of responsibility. \u2026 The United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, opened an investigation into the hospital bombings in August. The investigation, still going on, is meant in part to determine why hospitals that voluntarily added their locations to a United Nations-sponsored deconfliction list, which was provided to Russia and other combatants to prevent them from being attacked, nevertheless came under attack. Syrian health care workers said they believed that the United Nations list actually became a target menu for the Russian and Syrian air forces.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cTrump tried to keep his talks with Putin at Helsinki last year secret from his staff and the world, but Russia's president held up the checklist for the cameras. Syria was on it,\u201d Julia Davis recalls in the Daily Beast: \u201cTrump is moving down Putin\u2019s wish list, fulfilling the Kremlin\u2019s aims at a rapid pace. He is chipping away at U.S. sanctions against Russia, deepening America\u2019s internal divisions on the basis of race, faith, sexual orientation and political affiliation, vocally undermining confidence in our elections, intelligence agencies and institutions, all the while empowering our foreign adversaries and undermining NATO alliances. Trump\u2019s claims that Ukraine\u2014not Russia\u2014is somehow responsible for the 2016 election interference fall right in line with conspiracy theories the Kremlin has been propagating for years. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe ousting of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, was also in line with the Kremlin\u2019s wishes. Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk [Putin is the godfather of his daughter] has a longstanding grudge against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Medvedchuk cheered for the U.S. ambassador to be recalled and the Russian state media predicted that Ambassador Yovanovitch would be Trump\u2019s \u2018first victim in Ukraine.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- \u201cWashington\u2019s abrupt decision to ditch the Kurds contrasted sharply with Moscow\u2019s unwavering support for its ally Assad,\u201d the AP\u2019s Vladimir Isachenkov reports from Moscow. \u201cIn another power game, Russia hopes to see major gains in its long-running effort to retain leverage over its neighbor Ukraine \u2026 President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was elected by a landslide in April, has vowed to end the fighting [in eastern Ukraine], which has killed more than 13,000. Early this month, Ukraine, Russia and the rebels signed a tentative agreement to hold local elections in the east, a deal Zelenskiy insists conforms to a 2015 peace accord that was brokered by France and Germany. The agreement, however, has been criticized by some in Ukraine as \u2018capitulation\u201d to Moscow. On Monday, far-right and nationalist groups are staging a major rally in Kyiv to protest Zelenskiy\u2019s peace plan.\n\n\u201cThe White House\u2019s publication of a rough transcript of the call was embarrassing for the 41-year-old Ukrainian president because it showed him eager to please Trump and dismissive of European partners whose support he needs to end the conflict in the east. While Zelenskiy sought to play it down, it could help Russia by eroding support for Ukraine in Germany and France. \u2018France and Germany have grown tired of Ukraine and are too busy with their own problems, and their only goal is to close the issue of the war in the east by any means,\u2019 said Vadim Karasev, head of the Institute of Global Strategies, an independent Kyiv-based think tank. \u2018If Russia offers a compromise, Berlin and Paris will heave a sigh of relief. By publicly kicking (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel and (French President Emmanuel) Macron, Zelenskiy untied their hands and there is no more talk about their \u2018friendly support.\u201d\n\n-- Syria and Ukraine fit with a broader pattern. Trump has pushed to bring Russia back into the Group of Seven, which it was expelled from after invading Ukraine. To fund construction of his border wall, he diverted $770 million from projects that have been approved to help American allies deter Russian attacks. He\u2019s cast doubt on whether the U.S. would live up to its mutual defense obligations under the NATO charter. He\u2019s supported Brexit and antagonized the European Union by picking fights over trade. It\u2019s impossible to calculate the Kremlin\u2019s return on investment for its 2016 interference in the U.S. election. Trump told two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017 that he was unconcerned about their interference in our presidential election because the United States does the same in other countries.\n\n-- As 2020 approaches, there is no doubt that Russian interests continue to favor Trump. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the Soviet-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested last Wednesday night at Dulles as they prepared to leave the U.S. with one-way plane tickets to Europe, have made $630,000 in contributions to Republican candidates and political action committees since the fall of 2016, including $325,000 to a pro-Trump PAC. The men have been charged with campaign finance violations, including routing illegal contributions to federal candidates from an unidentified Russian source.\n\n-- Before leaving the White House to hit the links at his golf course on Sunday, Trump defended his decision as \u201cvery smart\u201d and accused \u201cthose that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars\u201d of pushing the United States to stay in \u201cendless wars.\u201d Trump tweeted that it was \u201cvery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change.\u201d For the past week, White House officials have been adamant that Trump did not greenlight Turkey\u2019s invasion. But Trump undercut those denials somewhat with his tweets. \u201cOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet them!\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s order to withdraw came after he privately agitated for days to bring troops home, according to administration officials, even while the Pentagon was making public assurances that the United States was not abandoning its Kurdish allies in the region. \u201cThe officials, granted anonymity to describe internal deliberations, described Trump as \u2018doubling down\u2019 and \u2018undeterred,\u2019 despite vociferous pushback from congressional Republicans who have been loath to challenge the president,\u201d Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report.\n\n\u201cDuring deliberations in the past, Trump has repeatedly pushed to remove troops from Syria but has usually been dissuaded by top officials, such as John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff. The usual argument against removing troops, according to former senior administration officials, would be that doing so would cause widespread deaths and chaos and Trump would be blamed for it. \u2018Normally, convincing him he would be blamed for death and chaos could keep it from happening at least at that moment,\u2019 one former senior administration official said. But current administration officials say many moderating officials like Kelly are gone, and longtime friends say the move is consistent with Trump\u2019s worldview \u2014 and that he has long wanted to do this.\u201d\n\nTrump has closely watched conservative criticism in recent days: He\u2019s complained frequently about comments from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) but has been encouraged by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, according to administration officials. One senior administration official told Josh that the president was particularly heartened by a segment from another Fox host, Lou Dobbs, defending him last week.\n\n-- Graham, who previously called Trump\u2019s decision on Syria \u201cthe biggest blunder of his presidency,\u201d praised the president on Sunday for saying he\u2019ll support imposing some sanctions on Turkey. \u201cTurkey\u2019s actions will only benefit ISIS, Iran, and Russia, and creates a nightmare for Israel,\u201d Graham tweeted.\n\n-- Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Turkey was fully committed to its operation regardless of what the United States did, and that the administration did not want to go to war with a member of NATO. Esper added that Turkey is not acting like much of an ally. \u201cI think Turkey, the arc of their behavior over the past several years, has been terrible,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI mean, they are spinning out of the Western orbit, if you will.\u201d\n\n-- House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said NATO should consider expelling Turkey as a member, citing Ankara\u2019s partnership with Moscow: \u201cHow do you have a NATO ally who\u2019s in cahoots with the Russians when the Russians are the adversaries of NATO? ... [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan\u2019s a bad guy, and I\u2019m disgusted that the American president would feel comfortable with someone like Erdogan,\u201d Engel said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d promising that the House will take up sanctions against Turkey this week and on a resolution to condemn Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cI can think of nothing more disgusting, in all the years I\u2019ve been in Congress, than what this president is allowing to happen with the Kurds.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cAmid reports of Islamic State militants escaping prisons in the area, a U.S. official confirmed that the American forces had been unable to carry out plans to move several dozen high-value detainees to more secure locations,\u201d Karen DeYoung, Dan Lamothe, Missy Ryan and Kareem Fahim report. \u201cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped. \u2026 Turkey launched multiple artillery rounds Friday near a U.S. Special Operations outpost in the area, despite knowing its location, officials said. \u2026 Although \u2018the Turks gave guarantees to us\u2019 that U.S. forces would not be harmed, [a senior administration] official said, Syrian militias allied with them \u2018are running up and down roads, ambushing and attacking vehicles,\u2019 putting American forces \u2014 as well as civilians \u2014 in danger even as they withdraw. The militias, known as the Free Syrian Army, \u2018are crazy and not reliable.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- \u201cSome of the Special Forces officers who battled alongside the Kurds say they feel deep remorse at orders to abandon their allies,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cThey trusted us, and we broke that trust,\u201d said one Army officer who has worked alongside the Kurds in northern Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s a stain on the American conscience.\u201d Another officer who also served in northern Syria added: \u201cI\u2019m ashamed.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThere is blood on Trump's hands for abandoning our Kurdish allies,\u201d said retired Marine general John Allen. The four-star general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan and served as President Barack Obama\u2019s special envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS told CNN that this weekend\u2019s events were \u201ccompletely foreseeable\u201d after the U.S. \u201cgreenlighted\u201d Turkey\u2019s incursion. \u201cThere was no chance Erdogan would keep his promise, and full-blown ethnic cleansing is underway by Turkish supported militias,\u201d said Allen, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cThis is what happens when Trump follows his instincts and because of his alignment with autocrats.\u201d\n\n-- Trump faced bipartisan congressional criticism on the Sunday shows for his Syria decision. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air Force veteran who was a pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan, was among the most vocal members of the president\u2019s party to condemn the move. \u2018You hear the president and people like Rand Paul talk about endless wars all the time, and it\u2019s kitschy. But actually, we were preventing an endless war,\u2019 Kinzinger said [on CBS]. He added that \u2018for me \u2014 as a guy that served in the military and really got into politics because I believe in the role America plays \u2014 to see this yet again, you know, leaving an ally behind ... is disheartening, depressing.\u2019 \u2026 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, announced that both chambers are readying a joint resolution urging Trump to reverse his decision.\u201d\n\nBefore Trump gave Saturday\u2019s order, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime.\u201d\n\n-- Turkish-linked forces filmed themselves executing a Kurdish captive in Syria. Liz Sly reports: \u201cThe most gruesome and explicit of the videos shows Turkish-allied Syrian fighters pumping bursts of automatic fire into the body of a bound man lying on the side of a desert road as a gunman shouts to his comrades to take his phone and film him doing the shooting. Another trembling, handcuffed man crouches on the opposite side of the road as the shooting erupts. \u2018Kill them,\u2019 one man is heard shouting. The video is one of a series of photographs and videos posted on Twitter accounts of the Turkish-backed rebel groups and circulated by the [SDF] that suggest some of the Syrian rebels participating in Turkey\u2019s offensive to capture territory in Syria might have committed war crimes.\u201d\n\n-- Connecting the dots: \u201cThe uproar in Washington over President Trump\u2019s corruption in Ukraine and malfeasance in Syria has obscured a broader story,\u201d writes deputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl. \u201cIn little more than a month, virtually every other foreign policy initiative the Trump administration has pursued has imploded \u2014 thanks mostly to the president\u2019s increasingly unhinged behavior. The unraveling started on Sept. 7, when Trump abruptly announced that he had canceled a previously undisclosed summit with the Afghan Taliban due to be held the next day at Camp David, and shelved a draft peace deal that a State Department special envoy had spent a year negotiating. The immediate result was a spike in violence in Afghanistan \u2014 and at least the temporary shelving of Trump\u2019s ambition to pull U.S. troops out of the country before the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cA week later, Trump\u2019s \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 campaign against Iran came undone. Following an Iranian-sponsored attack on a Saudi oil complex, Trump ruled out a military response; instead, he told French President Emmanuel Macron that he was open to a plan to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations and lift sanctions on his government in return for negotiations. The gambit failed: Rouhani left Trump waiting on a phone line. \u2026\n\n\u201cJust two weeks after the Iran debacle, Trump saw his nuclear negotiations with North Korea crumble \u2014 again. At a meeting in Stockholm, Kim Jong Un\u2019s delegation rejected a U.S. proposal for an incremental deal \u2014 a far cry from the total disarmament Trump once sought \u2014 and walked away, refusing to agree to a date for future talks. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe attempt to oust the socialist government of Venezuela flopped back in April. The plan for the \u2018ultimate deal\u2019 between Israelis and Palestinians has never been released, and Trump\u2019s point man on that project, Jason Greenblatt, announced his departure last month. True, Trump is still pressing his trade war with China and announced a partial deal on Friday. But most tariffs remain in place and the easy victory over Beijing he once promised is nowhere in sight.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nTyphoon Hagibis put large swaths of Japan underwater. (Kyodo News\/AP)\n\n-- A typhoon left at least 42 people dead and 15 missing in Japan. Simon Denyer reports: \u201cTyphoon Hagibis, which means \u2018speed\u2019 in the Philippine language Tagalog, tore through Tokyo and large swaths of Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday, bringing record-breaking rains to many areas. By Sunday, more than 20 rivers in central and northeastern Japan had burst their banks, flooding more than 1,000 homes in cities, towns and villages. At one point, the government advised nearly 8 million people to evacuate. Many ignored the advice and stayed home, but others headed to shelters. Public broadcaster NHK said some died while trying to make their way to shelters, including a 77-year-old woman who fell more than 100 feet to her death during an airlift. NHK reported Monday that 198 people were injured in the storm. The storm sank a Panama-registered cargo ship anchored near Tokyo, killing at least five crew members and leaving three missing, according to local media reports. Around 200,000 homes were without power on Sunday, Japanese media reported.\u201d\n\nTHE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:\n\n-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said protecting the identity of the first whistleblower who sounded the alarm about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine is the committee\u2019s \u201cprimary interest,\u201d a sign that House Democrats may not press the individual to testify. On CBS's \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Schiff noted there\u2019s more than one whistleblower. \u201cGiven that we already have the call record, we don\u2019t need the whistleblower who wasn\u2019t on the call to tell us what took place during the call,\u201d the chairman explained. \u201cWe have the best evidence of that.\u201d (Felicia Sonmez)\n\n-- The former top Russia specialist on the National Security Council, Fiona Hill, is expected to give a deposition today to House investigators. Hill, a Trump appointee but also a frequent critic of Putin, helped navigate the U.S. policy with Moscow before leaving the administration this summer. (USA Today)\n\n-- Mark Esper, the defense secretary, said the Pentagon will try to comply with a subpoena from committees seeking records related to the U.S. withholding military aid from Ukraine. From the Guardian: \u201c\u2018We will do everything we can to respond to their inquiry,\u2019 he said on Fox News Sunday. But Esper warned \u2026 that Trump and other officials may yet create complications for the compliance before Tuesday\u2019s deadline for him to respond.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s advisers are back to square one in their search for a new defense lawyer after lobbying rules prohibited former congressman Trey Gowdy from joining the president\u2019s defense team. From the Times: \u201cMr. Gowdy\u2019s name began circulating on Twitter as the new Trump defender, prompting a number of aides to the president to claim credit privately for the idea of bringing him on board. But by Wednesday evening, aides were distancing themselves from the bungled personnel maneuver, which was made public before all the usual procedural boxes had been checked. Several pointed fingers at Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, suggesting he had botched the rollout. \u2026 As Mr. Mulvaney pushed for Mr. Gowdy, a former House colleague and fellow South Carolinian, he swatted away questions from several aides about whether Mr. Gowdy would be curtailed in his role by lobbying regulations.\u201d\n\n-- A longtime investigative reporter in Nashville grilled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Ukraine. He baselessly accused her of working for the Democratic National Committee. Brittany Shammas reports: Nancy Amons \u201chad just seven minutes to interview [Pompeo] \u2026 She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with [Giuliani] while in Warsaw, and he refused to say. Undeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that U.S. diplomats thought a relationship between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president was contingent upon Ukraine investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals. That\u2019s when Pompeo lost his cool.\u201d (Watch the interview here.)\n\n-- In case you missed it: The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, intends to tell Congress this week that the content of a text message he wrote denying a quid pro quo with Ukraine was relayed to him directly by Trump in a phone call. Aaron Davis and John Hudson previewed the ambassador\u2019s planned testimony in the Sunday paper: \u201cSondland plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment. \u2018It\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u2019 said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony [who spoke to The Post with his permission] \u2026\n\n\u201cSondland is expected to say that for months before the Sept. 9 message, he worked at the direction of [Giuliani] to secure what he would call in another text message the \u2018deliverable\u2019 sought by Trump: a public statement from Ukraine that it would investigate corruption, including mentioning Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, by name. In exchange for the statement, the president would grant Ukraine\u2019s new president a coveted White House audience. \u2018It was a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,\u2019 the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony said.\n\n\u201cSondland appears poised to say that he and other diplomats did not know that the request to mention Burisma was really an effort to impugn the reputations of [former vice president Joe] Biden and his son Hunter, who had served as a Burisma board member. Sondland contends that he didn\u2019t know about the Biden connection until a whistleblower complaint and transcript surfaced in late September. To trust Sondland\u2019s testimony, members of Congress will have to believe Sondland had not seen televised appearances by Giuliani over the spring and summer, or numerous newspaper and magazine articles questioning whether Hunter Biden\u2019s role at Burisma could prove to be a drag on his father\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201d\n\n-- The impeachment crisis is shining a spotlight on Trump\u2019s state of mind. Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker report: \u201cLike an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected \u2014 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \u2014 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone. ... Staring down impeachment, Trump has seemed to play the role of the nation\u2019s Shakespearean monarch. \u2026 Victimization has long been central to Trump\u2019s political identity, rooting him in the grievance politics of the right and inspiring in his millions of followers a duty to protect the president from any perceived threat. But Trump\u2019s feelings of oppression and persecution have been especially pronounced during the impeachment crisis. \u2026\n\n\u201cAs has long been his habit, Trump has applied derogatory nicknames to his impeachment antagonists. Schiff is \u2018Shifty Schiff,\u2019 Pelosi is \u2018Nervous Nancy\u2019 and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump\u2019s conduct, is \u2018Pompous Senator.\u2019 \u2026 To Trump, the impeachment probe is evidence of a plot to remove him from office, part of a dystopian alternate reality he is combating with ominous language and dark proclamations. \u2026 Schiff has been a particular target of Trump\u2019s apocalyptic world view. The president has suggested on Twitter no fewer than four times, for instance, that Schiff might be guilty of treason \u2014 a crime still punishable by death.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden arrives in Beijing with his father, then the vice president, in 2013. The younger Biden met with a business partner during the trip and introduced him to the elder Biden. (Ng Han Guan\/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Hunter Biden will resign from the board of a Chinese investment company by the end of this month and promises not to do any work for foreign firms if his father is elected president, his lawyer George Mesires said in a statement on Sunday. Michael Kranish and Anna Fifield report: \u201cMesires did not say how much Hunter Biden earned in his work for Burisma [in Ukraine]. Some reports have said he was paid as much as $50,000 a month for a directorship that lasted five years. Mesires said Hunter Biden was paid nothing for his service as a director for the Chinese company and has yet to make a profit from his 2017 purchase of a 10 percent stake in that company, which he said is worth $430,000. ...\n\n\u201cMuch about Hunter Biden\u2019s China dealings is unknown because many records of the company are not public, and he has declined interview requests to discuss his work for the company. His involvement in the company has its roots in 2012, when his father was running for reelection for vice president. Jonathan Li, a Chinese businessman who would become the chief executive of BHR, was friendly with an American investor named Devon Archer. At the time, Archer was a partner in an investment company with Hunter Biden \u2026 In 2012, Li visited Archer in New York City to find a suitable investment partner. He met with Archer, who recommended himself. \u2026 It\u2019s not clear whether Hunter Biden did anything other than provide a high-profile name \u2014 and a connection to the vice president of the United States \u2014 that might lure investors. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe joint venture took months to be finalized, but approval was near when Joe and Hunter Biden arrived aboard Air Force Two in Beijing in December 2013. \u2026 He later summarized his talks with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, by dismissing the notion that China posed an economic threat to the United States. \u2026 The day after the vice president held talks with Xi, he and Hunter were at the hotel where the American delegation stayed. Hunter Biden \u2026 introduced Li to his father \u2026 Twelve days after the Bidens arrived in Beijing, the BHR business filing was completed. Archer was named vice chairman, and Hunter Biden became a director. \u2026 The other partners included Chinese entities with ties to the communist government, including the Bank of China, one of the biggest state-owned commercial banks in the country.\u201d\n\n-- Joe Biden, speaking on Sunday afternoon to reporters in Iowa, said he did not see the statement from his son\u2019s attorney before it was released, but he said he supports it. The former vice president said that his son \u201cdid not realize\u201d that \u201cthe appearance\u201d of doing business in Ukraine and China would raise so many questions. \u201cIf I am your president,\u201d the elder Biden said, \u201cI am going to build on the squeaky-clean White House that we had in the Obama-Biden administration.\u201d\n\n-- Biden will face tough questions in tomorrow night's Democratic debate about his son's sketchy buckraking, and Elizabeth Warren is a tempting target because she's surging. But the stakes are probably highest for Bernie Sanders, who has been slipping since his heart attack. Sean Sullivan reports: \u201cScrutiny of his age and endurance are greater than at any point in his nearly half-century political career. A strong performance could help calm the doubts about his prospects as the oldest candidate in the field, while a weak showing could deal a devastating blow to a campaign that was already slipping.\u201d\n\n-- Warren continues to rise across the early states, drawing even with Biden and Sanders in Iowa, according to a CBS News battlegrounds poll. Meanwhile, voters have said Biden\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s accusations has left them \u201csomewhat\u201d satisfied, not \u201cvery\u201d satisfied. Warren is seen as generally better able than Biden to handle Trump\u2019s inevitable attacks, the CBS poll found.\n\n-- What\u2019s missing from Warren\u2019s 2020 surge? Democratic endorsements, per the Times: \u201cMs. Warren is expected to reveal additional support from Democratic officials this week in conjunction with [Tuesday\u2019s debate] and the release of her smashing third-quarter financial disclosure. Yet her growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them. \u2026 Just under four months before the leadoff Iowa caucuses she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts. She does have the backing of the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group, and yet she also has fewer total endorsements from state legislators in Iowa and New Hampshire than Senator Cory Booker.\u201d\n\n-- A macabre video of a fake Trump shooting, stabbing and brutally assaulting members of the news media and his political opponents was played at his Miami resort during a conference for his supporters. From the Times: \u201cThe video, which includes the logo for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign, comprises a series of internet memes. The most violent clip shows Mr. Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \u2018Church of Fake News\u2019 on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies. It appears to be an edited scene of a church massacre from the 2014 dark comedy film \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service.\u2019 \u2026 The organizer of the event said in a statement on Sunday that the clip had been played at the conference, saying it was part of a \u2018meme exhibit.\u2019 He denounced the video and said his organization was looking into how it was shown at the event. \u2026 A spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign said he knew nothing about the video.\u201d\n\n-- Queen made the Trump campaign take down a video that used \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d as its soundtrack, days after Prince\u2019s estate publicly criticized Trump for playing \u201cPurple Rain\u201d during his Minneapolis rally. The video with the Queen song had been viewed more than 1.7 million times before it was removed from Trump\u2019s official Twitter page. (BuzzFeed News)\n\n-- Democrats are struggling to make inroads in rural Virginia in off-year elections. Patricia Sullivan reports from the Shenandoah Valley: \u201cShort of big-money donors, they have pooled resources to share one consultant, who provides individual field plans for each race, coordinates schedules and exchanges policy ideas. The candidates have a polished joint presentation for when they seek funds and volunteers from around the state, including a late-September visit to the deeply blue Arlington County. \u2026 But in this mountainous portion of the commonwealth, where cellphone signals do not always penetrate and the lack of universal broadband vexes residents, the Democrats have a steep climb.\u201d\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- A black woman was fatally shot in her own home by a white Fort Worth police officer who was responding to a call about an open door at the residence. Derek Hawkins reports: \u201cA neighbor told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he dialed a non-emergency line and requested a welfare check when he noticed that the door was ajar and the lights were on. While searching the outside of the house, police said, an officer saw someone standing near a window. \u2018Perceiving a threat the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside the residence,\u2019 police said. Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to police, who said the officers provided emergency medical care. Body-camera footage released by police Saturday shows two officers walking quietly around the side of the house and peering through two screen doors, then moving down a driveway into a backyard. One officer approaches a closed first-floor window and shines a flashlight inside, then swiftly raises his gun. \u2018Put your hands up! Show me your hands!\u2019 he yells. A split-second later, he fires a shot through the window. He does not identify himself as an officer in the footage. \u2026\n\n\u201cOfficials did not release the officer\u2019s name, describing him only as a white male who has been with the department since April 2018. He will be placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, according to the department. The shooting comes at a time when relations between law enforcement and black residents in the Dallas and Fort Worth area are already under strain following the recent trial of Amber Guyger, a white former police officer who shot and killed her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, in 2018. \u2026\n\n\u201cLee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney in the Dallas area who said he is representing Jefferson\u2019s family, said the officer never should have opened fire. Jefferson was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when she heard what she thought was a prowler outside the bedroom window, Merritt wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. When Jefferson went to the window to see what was happening, he wrote, the officer shot her.\u201d\n\n-- Prosecutors are reexamining a killing after the Missouri deputy behind it was charged in another shooting. The deputy, Lauren Michael, received a medal of valor after fatally shooting a man in 2017 who she said was reaching for her Taser. Her retelling is under scrutiny after she was charged last week with felony assault and armed criminal action after shooting an unarmed woman in the back. (NYT)\n\n-- Three economists received the Nobel Prize in economics for their \u201cexperimental approach\u201d to solving global poverty. The winners are MIT\u2019s Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo and Harvard\u2019s Michael Kremer. (Jeff Stein)\n\n-- The first two days of California\u2019s blackouts cost the state economy somewhere between $65 million and $2.5 billion. From the Journal: \u201cMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said a hit of even several hundred million dollars \u2018doesn\u2019t register in a $3 trillion-a-year economy like California\u2019s.\u2019 He added that if the blackouts continue on for much longer the economic toll will mount, particularly if businesses feel this will be an endemic problem. PG&E officials won\u2019t say how often or how long Californians could face the prospect of blackouts like this one.\u201d\n\n-- California became the first state in the country to mandate later start times at most public schools, a proposal designed to improve educational outcomes by giving students more sleep. From the Los Angeles Times: \u201cThe law will take effect over a phased-in period, ultimately requiring middle schools to begin classes at 8 a.m. or later while high schools will start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. \u2026 The American Academy of Pediatrics \u2026 pointed to studies that found links between later start times, more sleep and better health and school performance among adolescents.\u201d\n\n-- Dozens of death investigations across the country have been complicated or upended because transplantable body parts were taken before an autopsy was performed. From the LA Times: \u201cIn multiple cases, coroners have had to guess at the cause of death. Wrongful-death and medical malpractice lawsuits have been thwarted by early tissue harvesting. A death after a fight with police remains unsettled. The procurement process caused changes to bodies that medical examiners mistook as injuries or abuse. In at least one case, a murder charge was dropped. Organ procurement before an investigation has long been legal, provided the coroner agreed. The motivation was to increase the number of [vital organs] needed to extend the lives of Americans waiting for transplants. To raise those numbers, California and other states over the last decade passed laws requiring coroners and medical examiners to \u2018cooperate\u2019 with the companies to \u2018maximize\u2019 the number of organs and tissues taken for transplant.\u201d\n\n-- The Census Bureau is asking for driver\u2019s license records that typically include citizenship data and has also made a request for information on recipients of government assistance after the Supreme Court blocked plans to include a citizenship question in the 2020 count. From the AP: \u201cThe two approaches, documented by The Associated Press, alarm civil rights activists. They caution that inaccuracies in state motor vehicle records make them a poor choice for tracking citizenship, if that is the bureau\u2019s goal, and they see the requests as an extension of earlier efforts that could chill Latino participation in the 2020 Census.\u201d\n\n-- On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about whether states can prosecute migrants who use other people\u2019s Social Security numbers to get a job. From the AP: \u201cThe case before the nation\u2019s highest court arises from three prosecutions in Johnson County, a largely suburban area outside Kansas City, Missouri, where the district attorney has aggressively pursued immigrants under the Kansas identity theft and false-information statutes.\u201d\n\n-- Almost 400 scientists have endorsed a civil disobedience campaign aimed at forcing governments to take rapid action to tackle climate change. From Reuters: \u201cIn a joint declaration, climate scientists, physicists, biologists, engineers and others from at least 20 countries broke with the caution traditionally associated with academia to side with peaceful protesters courting arrest from Amsterdam to Melbourne. \u2026 The declaration was coordinated by a group of scientists who support Extinction Rebellion, a civil disobedience campaign that formed in Britain a year ago and has since sparked offshoots in dozens of countries.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nBeto O'Rourke's campaign manager tried to walk back the former congressman's comments from Thursday night's CNN town hall:\n\nIf a religious organization discriminates based on sexual orientation or gender identity when delivering public services, they shouldn't be tax-exempt.

The price isn\u2019t the price anymore, they argue.\n\n[Tipping on a sliding scale. People have lots of opinions about it.]\n\n\u201cTipping isn\u2019t just a restaurant issue,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cGratuities affect a wide range of service workers, from hotel housekeepers to tour guides. And this isn\u2019t about depriving servers, housekeepers or tour guides of their salary. It\u2019s about truth in advertising.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s for a hotel room, a restaurant meal or even a muffin, businesses owe it to their customers to be upfront about the true and full cost, Elliott said.\n\n\u201cOne of the tenets of capitalism is that you tell the truth about your prices,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you say that this cup of coffee is going to cost $2, then you should be able to pay $2 for it. And that\u2019s the end of the transaction.\u201d\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not happening, which is causing tipping fatigue, especially for travelers. The economics of the service industry has shifted to make it the direct responsibility of the customers to subsidize the salary of the workers.\n\nTips are no longer really optional.\n\nGoing on a cruise? There are a number of people who will expect a tip. That scuba-diving excursion means tipping the guide.\n\nDon\u2019t get Elliott (or anyone else, for that matter) started on how airline tickets are priced. Spirit Airlines charges travelers to have a customer service agent print out a boarding pass. Does it really cost $10 to print out a piece of paper?\n\nIt\u2019s at the point where travelers need to pack a lot of cash just to tip all the people helping them along their journey.\n\nElliott, meanwhile, is opposed to the suggestion that restaurant customers tip 20 percent, no matter the quality of service.\n\n\u201cA mandatory 20 percent tip is a slippery slope,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how it plays out in the travel industry. Cruise lines now \u2018automatically\u2019 add tips to your final bill. In coffee shops, you\u2019re getting hit up for a tip before you get your beverage. Hotels add tips to your room service tab. No one is against employees being paid a fair wage. But you don\u2019t do that by lying to customers about prices. You raise your prices to the point where you can pay your workers a living wage.\u201d\n\nMany of the readers who wrote me said they don\u2019t like the anxiety that comes with tipping. \u201cWhat\u2019s fair?\u201d they worry. They\u2019re concerned they\u2019ll insult someone or tip too much.\n\n\u201cI always tip,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cI just struggle to determine how much to tip.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are guides to help you figure out how much to tip \u2014 for example. the tipping guide at the Emily Post Institute.\n\n[Let\u2019s talk about tipping]\n\nHere are some questions from readers unsure of what to do in certain situations, and my answers.\n\nQ: Do you tip before or after taxes?\n\nA: There\u2019s no consensus on this issue. The general tipping guide for the Emily Post Institute on etiquette says you tip pretax.\n\nHowever, some servers argue that quibbling over whether you should tip pre- or post- the tax is petty.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say your meal pretax comes to $100. With a 6 percent sales tax the bill comes to $106. Before taxes a 20 percent tip would bring the bill to $120. At $106 including tax your bill would be $121.20.\n\nSo, no, you aren\u2019t going against etiquette protocol to base your tip on just the meal and not the tax. Neither should you be called a miser if you tip pretax. But just consider that the extra money could go a long way for someone trying to make ends meet on a low-wage salary.\n\nQ: If you have a coupon, do you base your tip on the discounted price?\n\nA: Your tip should be based on the original menu price.\n\nQ: If you get something complimentary at a restaurant, do you tip the same percentage as if it hadn\u2019t been free?\n\nA: Tip on the full value of the comped meal or item.\n\nToday, service always has a cost \u2014 and is never subject to a discount.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.

Sandys\/The Washington Post)\n\nA look at the good (Hail!) and bad (Fail!) from the Redskins\u2019 17-16 win over the Dolphins on Sunday.\n\nHail: Scary Terry\n\nIf you\u2019re still looking for a Halloween costume idea, consider a Terry McLaurin Redskins jersey. The rookie wide receiver continues to be a nightmare for NFL defenses. Dolphins rookie cornerback Ken Webster made his first career start after Pro Bowl cornerback Xavien Howard was ruled out against Washington, and he didn\u2019t stand a chance against McLaurin. The Redskins\u2019 third-round pick finished with four catches for 100 yards, including his fourth and fifth touchdown grabs of the season. McLaurin had a rare drop early in the fourth quarter, but he made up for it later, hauling in a 32-yard catch that enabled Washington to get out of the shadow of its own end zone and burn some clock while protected a seven-point lead. \u201cI\u2019d like to take full credit for the Scary Terry nickname,\u201d Redskins quarterback Case Keenum told reporters after the game. \u201cI didn\u2019t patent it or anything, but maybe you guys can go back in the archives and look who said it first.

Washington went three-and-out on its first three possessions and didn\u2019t record a first down until its first play of the second quarter.\n\nHail: Shaun Dion Hamilton\n\nSafety Landon Collins had the best game for the Redskins\u2019 defense, with 12 tackles, two passes defended, a sack, a forced fumble and a near interception, but Hamilton was responsible for the best play. Midway through the third quarter, after the Redskins took a 14-3 lead on McLaurin\u2019s second touchdown catch, Hamilton anticipated a Josh Rosen pass intended for wide receiver Isaiah Ford and made a diving interception. The pick, which was more impressive than any of Washington\u2019s 13 receptions, was the Redskins\u2019 second of the day and seventh of the season. The team had 15 interceptions all of last year.\n\nThat's one hell of a catch by Shaun Dion Hamilton for the interception.#Redskins pic.twitter.com\/39ix2cRv4z \u2014 Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoRCC) October 13, 2019\n\nFail: Tanking For Tua\n\nThere are two types of Redskins fans: Those who look at Sunday\u2019s result, coupled with the Cowboys\u2019 surprising loss to the Jets, and think, \u201cWow, we\u2019re only two games out of the NFC East lead,\u201d and those who look at Sunday\u2019s result, coupled with the Bengals\u2019 expected loss to the Ravens and think, \u201cDarn, we\u2019re now a game out of the lead for the No. 1 pick.\u201d If you\u2019re in the latter camp, Sunday\u2019s win felt more like a loss.\n\nTua Tagovailoa just felt a sudden urge to register for his fall 2020 classes. \u2014 Adam Kilgore (@AdamKilgoreWP) October 13, 2019\n\nHail: Adrian Peterson\n\nThe 34-year-old running back proved he\u2019s still got it, at least against the league\u2019s worst rushing defense. Peterson finished with 23 carries for 118 yards, 60 of which came on one touchdown drive in the second quarter. Interim Coach Bill Callahan said last week that the Redskins would look to establish the run against the Dolphins, and Peterson did his part to make that game plan look smart. \u201cI take my hat off to the offensive line and receivers, they did a great job, tight ends they played outstanding and really got this offensive running game going,\u201d Peterson told NFL Network\u2019s Deion Sanders after his best game of the season. \u201cThat\u2019s what we needed, man.\u201d\n\nGreat shot by Fox here.

Washington should consider itself lucky that a deal never came to fruition. After Arizona drafted Kyler Murray with the No. 1 pick this year, Rosen was dealt to the Dolphins. Coach Brian Flores said last week that Rosen, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2018 draft, would be his team\u2019s starter for the remainder of the season, and if Miami\u2019s goal is to finish 0-16, there\u2019s not a better man for the job. Rosen was dreadful on Sunday, completing 15 of 25 passes for 85 yards and throwing two interceptions. By the fourth quarter, Flores decided he had seen enough, and benched Rosen in favor of Ryan Fitzpatrick. Afterward, Flores said Rosen will continue to start, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019ll finish. Asked whether he thought his coach was going back on his promise, Rosen replied, \u201cIt\u2019s above my pay grade.\"\n\nHail: Redskins Fans in Miami\n\nThe 76-year-old Redskins who paid $1,600 to fly a \u201cFire Bruce Allen\u201d banner over Hard Rock Stadium for two hours before Sunday\u2019s game told me there was almost as much burgundy and gold in the stands as aqua and orange.

(Julien Warnand\/EPA-EFE\/Shutterstock)\n\nEuropean leaders said Monday they were facing a direct security peril from Turkey\u2019s assault on Kurdish positions in Syria, as France scrambled to protect its troops inside the country, Belgium warned that it could face terrorist attacks and European Union foreign ministers voiced frustrations with Washington.\n\nThe situation in Syria was turning into a security vortex for European countries that have long played a supporting role for U.S. troops in combat with the Islamic State. President Trump decided late Saturday to pull all U.S. troops from the country within weeks, leaving allies struggling to respond.\n\nMany citizens of E.U. countries who joined the Islamic State have also been sitting in Kurdish-controlled prison camps in northeastern Syria. If they are released or break out, it is feared they could return covertly to Europe to carry out strikes after several years of relative quiet.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have magic powers\u201d to stop the Turkish assault, said Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, who is designated to become the E.U. foreign policy chief later this year. \u201cIf the American troops wouldn\u2019t have withdrawn, this attack would have been impossible. The American troop withdrawal was a condition in order to make the attack possible.\u201d\n\n[European leaders criticize Turkish offensive in Syria as U.S. accelerates pullout]\n\nIn Washington, Trump responded Monday morning to his critics, writing on Twitter: \u201cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost. \u2018Let the USA pay,\u2019 they said.\u201d\n\nHe theorized that the \u201cKurds may be releasing some to get us involved,\u201d adding: \u201cEasily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump concluded: \u201cBig sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!\u201d\n\nEuropean foreign ministers were meeting Monday in Luxembourg to discuss a possible E.U.-wide arms embargo against Turkey in response to the incursion. Already, several of the main European arms producers, including France and Germany, have blocked sales to Ankara.\n\nBut some countries were facing more direct military peril. British and French special forces have supported U.S. troops in Syria for years. French President Emmanuel Macron early Monday ordered that measures be taken \u201cin the coming hours to ensure the security of French military and civilian personnel present in the zone.\u201d\n\nAlthough Macron\u2019s office did not specify whether French troops would pull out entirely, French officials said over the summer that a full U.S. withdrawal would likely require France to depart as well.\n\nMacron also said security was being tightened on French soil because of the escape of some Islamic State prisoners from the Syrian prison camps.\n\nThe U.S. pullout also potentially imperils British special forces believed to be deployed to Syria. Britain does not typically comment publicly about the status of its special forces deployments. The Foreign Office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, in a picture taken from the Turkish side of the border in Ceylanpinar on Oct. 11, 2019, on the third day of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces.

But the frustrations were clear on Monday, with Europeans facing security risks from a situation they felt unable to resolve.\n\n\u201cAs Europeans, it must be said, we are not in a position to stop this,\u201d said Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn. He called for an arms blockade against Turkey instead.\n\nSome leaders said the situation shows that Europe must become militarily independent from the United States since they cannot rely on Washington to defend European interests.\n\n\u201cIt is time that the European Union . . . becomes as military independent as possible, because one sees clearly in this situation that one cannot count on the wider world,\u201d French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire told the FranceInfo broadcaster on Monday.\n\nAnd in Belgium, the country\u2019s chief prosecutor warned Monday that Belgian citizens who had been in the Kurdish-controlled prison camps for Islamic State sympathizers could return home and carry out attacks. He said he preferred repatriating Belgian citizens in a controlled manner so that they could face Belgian courts, although it is no longer clear whether that is possible.\n\nThe situation in Syria is \u201cout of control,\u201d Belgian Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw told Belgium\u2019s RTBF broadcaster on Monday. He said that terrorist attacks on Belgian soil in recent years \u201cwere committed by people who returned clandestinely.\u201d\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s in Brussels and William Branigin in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nAs Trump withdraws U.S. forces from northern Syria, his administration scrambles to respond\n\nU. S.-allied Kurds strike deal to bring Assad\u2019s Syrian troops back into Kurdish areas\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","16":"President Trump\u2019s order to withdraw essentially all U.S. forces from northern Syria came after the commander in chief privately agitated for days to bring troops home, according to administration officials \u2014 even while the Pentagon was making public assurances that the United States was not abandoning its Kurdish allies in the region.\n\nThe officials, granted anonymity to describe internal deliberations, described Trump as \u201cdoubling down\u201d and \u201cundeterred,\u201d despite vociferous pushback from congressional Republicans who have been loath to challenge the president apart from a few issues, such as national security.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump has tried to convince advisers and lawmakers that the United States is not to blame for Turkey\u2019s military offensive, which has targeted Kurdish fighters who have aided the U.S. fight against the Islamic State.\n\nBut experts \u2014 and many Republicans \u2014 say otherwise. And even Trump allies say the president needs to do a better job of selling the troop withdrawal to the public, beyond tweets.\n\nThe escalating crisis in northern Syria has prompted further criticism from foreign policy heavyweights in Trump\u2019s party, who argue that the president\u2019s strategies abroad send a concerning message to allies and endanger regional partners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always looked at the approach the administration takes as very transactional and very short-term in nature,\u201d former senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a phone interview Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s almost seeking headlines for the very next day, but not really thinking through the longer-term impact on our \u00adcountry.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet and later in the interview, Corker warned against the decision to withdraw support for Kurdish forces, telling The Post that it was a \u201cblight on our character.\u201d He said, too, that it would only embolden Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has given no indication that he would halt the offensive that began Wednesday despite the threat of sanctions from the U.S. Congress and international condemnation.\n\n\u201cTo pull the rug out and to do so in such a hasty manner, where there\u2019s been no preparation, nothing has been done to limit the damage to them, and as [former defense secretary Jim] Mattis and others have said, this is going to create additional activities, additional opportunities for ISIS . . . it\u2019s bad all the way around,\u201d said Corker, who has remained relatively quiet since he left office in January.\n\nSuch criticisms have been echoed publicly and privately by current Republican elected officials who have been increasingly alarmed by the withdrawal, announced in a late-night White House statement on Oct. 6 and fully fleshed out by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on Sunday.\n\nTrump has closely watched that kind of public criticism in recent days \u2014 complaining frequently about comments from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) in particular \u2014 but has been encouraged to stay the course by other allies who support a withdrawal, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson, according to administration officials.\n\nThe president, one senior administration official said, was particularly heartened by a segment from another Fox News host, Lou Dobbs, defending him last week.\n\n\n\nA U.S. soldier sits atop an armored vehicle in Syria's Hasakeh province near the Turkish border on Oct. 6. (Delil Souleiman\/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nFor his part, Graham appeared to be more aligned with Trump on Sunday evening, saying that he planned to work with Democratic and Republican lawmakers on economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe outrage in Syria about Turkey continues. The ripple effect I was concerned about has happened at a faster pace than I believed. The administration needs to be far more aggressive,\u201d Graham said in an interview.\n\nGraham and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have drafted legislation that would place sanctions on the U.S. assets of people at the highest levels of the Turkish government, including Erdogan, as well as on any military transactions with Turkey.\n\nThe two are circulating their plan among Senate offices.\n\nGraham and Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) have also asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to arrange a briefing from the Pentagon and State Department, as well as intelligence officials, on the withdrawal.\n\nAn aide to Schumer deferred to the majority leader\u2019s office, although Schumer has said that he wants Esper; Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of U.S. Central Command, to appear publicly before senators. A spokesman for McConnell said Sunday that he had no announcements to make. A private briefing could help shape the congressional response, as could a closed-door Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Syria scheduled for Thursday morning.\n\nSome Republican donors and officials worried that Trump\u2019s decision would trap them in an untenable situation and have deleterious effects around the world. Furthermore, the significant intraparty rift is coming at a time when Trump particularly needs Republican support as he faces the threat of impeachment.\n\n\u201cRepublican senators are going to increasingly resemble a herd of ostriches with their heads in the sand,\u201d said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to break with Trump while simultaneously wanting to disagree with his policy on allowing Turkey to get away with exterminating the Kurds inside Syria.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump has resisted the repeated urging from some of his closest allies to intervene in the situation and has become more convinced that bringing troops home is both the right decision and a key political promise to fulfill ahead of the 2020 \u00adelection.\n\nThat view has been reinforced by the reaction from supporters. At a campaign rally in Minneapolis last week, the crowd chanted \u201cBring them home!\u201d as Trump noted that U.S. troops had been in Afghanistan \u2014 the longest war in American history \u2014 for nearly two decades.\n\nDuring deliberations in the past, Trump has repeatedly pushed to remove troops from Syria but has usually been dissuaded by top officials, such as John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff.\n\nThe usual argument against removing troops, according to former senior administration officials, would be that doing so would cause widespread deaths and chaos and Trump would be blamed for it.\n\n\u201cNormally, convincing him he would be blamed for death and chaos could keep it from happening at least at that moment,\u201d one former senior administration official said.\n\nBut current administration officials say many moderating officials like Kelly are gone, and longtime friends say the move is consistent with Trump\u2019s worldview \u2014 and that he has long wanted to do this.\n\n\u201cWhen he looks at a conflict, he\u2019ll say, do we have a national interest? What is our national interest?\u201d said Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally. \u201cA secondary thing is the money issue. Why are we spending billions, if not trillions, in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East?\u201d\n\nCorker also suggested that the president\u2019s decision was swayed by a circle of current advisers putting \u201cun-thought-out ideas in the president\u2019s head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just have known through my years there that so many people have access to the president,\u201d Corker said, declining to name them. \u201cTypically, you want the people who are giving input to have credentials and have knowledge of the area, but I know that\u2019s not the case necessarily today.\u201d\n\nSome Trump allies were urging him to do more. Retired Gen. Jack Keane, who regularly speaks with Trump and has been a candidate for positions in the past, said he should quickly enforce a no-fly zone and warn Turkish officials that there would be retaliation.\n\nKeane said international allies had flooded the State Department with concerns about trusting the United States.\n\n\u201cAll is not lost,\u201d he said. But not doing anything, he said, \u201csends a message about trust and reliability, something the United States has taken some pride in since World War II, that we can be counted on.\u201d","17":"\u201dBetween the Towers,\u201d shown here, is the central image in Mordicai Gerstein\u2019s 2003 children\u2019s book \u201cThe Man Who Walked Between the Towers.\u201d (Mordicai Gerstein\/Courtesy of R. Michelson Galleries)\n\nMordicai Gerstein, a children\u2019s author and illustrator whose imaginative, exuberant works included a celebrated picture book in which he set out to \u201cresurrect\u201d the fallen World Trade Center towers \u2014 if only on the page \u2014 by retelling the true story of a French tightrope walker who once crisscrossed the air between them, died Sept. 24 at his home in Westhampton, Mass. He was 83.\n\nThe cause was esophageal cancer, said his wife, Susan Yard Harris.\n\nMr. Gerstein did not begin illustrating children\u2019s books until he was nearly 40, after working for more than a decade in film and TV animation. He found in picture books a vehicle of expression far more magical than any television screen, one with limitless possibilities for exploration and discovery.\n\n\u201cFor me, picture books are little theaters one holds in the hand and operates by turning the pages,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cI make my books for everyone, not just children. All of us are either children or have been children.\u201d\n\nHe created more than 40 books, filling them with artwork that invited comparisons to the paintings of Marc Chagall for the color and energy that animated them. His themes and source material knew almost no boundaries, drawing as they did from Greek mythology, the Old Testament and ancient Jewish traditions, \u201cThe Tibetan Book of the Dead,\u201d the natural world, and news stories that caught Mr. Gerstein\u2019s fancy.\n\nIn the latter category was \u201cThe Man Who Walked Between the Towers\u201d (2003), winner of the Caldecott Medal, the most prestigious honor for children\u2019s book illustrations. The book was based on the exploits of Philippe Petit, a French aerialist who in 1974 strung a cable between the twin towers in Lower Manhattan and then stunned New Yorkers a quarter-mile below by walking, even dancing, on the tightrope for 45 minutes.\n\n\n\nMr. Gerstein, who received the Caldecott Medal for his book \u201cThe Man Who Walked Between the Towers,\u201d died Sept. 24 at 83. (Seth Kaye Photography\/Courtesy of R. Michelson Galleries)\n\nMr. Gerstein, who worked for years in New York and knew Petit as a unicycle-riding, torch-juggling street performer, missed Petit\u2019s master performance at the World Trade Center that breezy August morning. But he read about it in the news and, enthralled by the idea, filed it away in his mind.\n\nHe returned to it soon after Sept. 11, 2001, when the twin towers were struck by hijacked airplanes in the deadliest terrorist attack ever on American soil. As the buildings collapsed, Mr. Gerstein said, he remembered Petit\u2019s tightrope walk \u2014 that jaunty display of derring-do in a place that, after 9\/11, would forever be remembered for the tragedy that had happened there.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to just tell the story of the walk \u2014 I wanted the book to be the walk between cardboard covers,\u201d Publishers Weekly quoted him as saying. \u201cI wanted this book to cause real vertigo, to put the reader, child or adult \u2014 and of course myself \u2014 on the wire.\u201d\n\nHe began the book in the fashion of fairy tales and stories from time immemorial: \u201cOnce there were two towers side by side . . .\u201d His illustrations of Petit on the tightrope relied on skillful use of perspective, bringing the reader into the sky with the birds soaring above.\n\nAnd then the flight ends.\n\n1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

And part of that memory is the joyful morning, August 7, 1974, when Philippe Petit walked between them in the air.\u201d\n\nLike the feat it recounted, \u201cThe Man Who Walked Between the Towers\u201d was \u201citself a daredevil act,\u201d literary reporter David Mehegan wrote in the Boston Globe, \u201ca story of New York\u2019s World Trade Center filled with wit and laughter, without smoke, flame, or horror.\u201d\n\nThe book \u201cis a milestone,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt proves that it is possible to speak of the twin towers, even with children, in a context other than murderous destruction.\u201d\n\nMordicai Menachem Mendel Gerstein was born in Los Angeles on Nov. 24, 1935. His father was a wholesale grocer who wrote plays in his retirement. His mother, a homemaker, instilled in her son a love of books and artwork.\n\nMr. Gerstein studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in California, now part of the California Institute of the Arts, before beginning his animation career in Los Angeles and then New York. He did film, television and commercial work before making his first foray into children\u2019s literature in the 1970s as the illustrator of the \u201cSomething Queer Is Going On\u201d mystery series by writer Elizabeth Levy, with whom he worked for decades.\n\nHe began to illustrate his own works in the 1980s, beginning with \u201cArnold of the Ducks,\u201d a story about a boy taken in and raised by ducks. In an early display of Mr. Gerstein\u2019s whimsy, the boy is returned to his family by a kite, although the quacking of ducks will always exert a pull on his heart. Mr. Gerstein said the manuscript was rejected seven times before it was published in 1983.\n\nHis other books included \u201cTales of Pan\u201d (1986), \u201cNoah and the Great Flood\u201d (1999) and \u201cThe White Ram: A Story of Abraham and Isaac\u201d (2006).\n\nIn \u201cWhat Charlie Heard\u201d (2002), he said he sought to help children see sound \u2014 as well as silence \u2014 on the page in his account of the life of the American modernist composer Charles Ives. His picture book \u201cThe Wild Boy,\u201d selected by the New York Times as one of the best illustrated books of 1998, as well as the young-adult novel \u201cVictor\u201d (also 1998), were based on the true story of a feral boy who emerged from the woods of southern France in the winter of 1800 and was civilized \u2014 to a degree \u2014 by a young doctor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always looking for things that puzzle and disturb or amuse me,\u201d he once said. \u201cI make books for people, most of whom happen to be children, and I try to address the most essential parts of all of us.\u201d\n\nMr. Gerstein\u2019s marriage to Sandra MacDonald ended in divorce. Their son Jesse Gerstein died in 1991. Survivors include his wife of 35 years, Susan Yard Harris of Westhampton; a son from his first marriage, Aram Gerstein of San Francisco; a daughter from his second marriage, Risa Harris-Gerstein of Brooklyn; a brother; two grandchildren; and a great-grandson.\n\nAs time passed after the publication of \u201cThe Man Who Walked Between the Towers,\u201d the book gathered new young readers, with new grown-ups to guide them through the story. Instead of parents who had turned off the TV to spare their children the news footage of airplanes tearing through skyscrapers, there were parents who had seen those images when they were young, and their own children, who would know 9\/11 only as an event in history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a fairy tale,\u201d Mr. Gerstein told the Globe, speaking of his book. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to restore the towers to children whose only image of them is on fire. It shows them in another context \u2014 how big they were, and the space between them. I resurrect them in the mind.\u201d","18":"We encourage new and innovative uses of our content, and we want our readers to have access to our content in a wide variety of different ways.

There still are possibilities for the Steelers in 2019 as they enter their bye week, thanks to a 24-17 triumph Sunday night in Carson, Calif., over the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRoethlisberger, the two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, was nowhere to be seen. He didn\u2019t make the trip after undergoing season-ending elbow surgery. Mason Rudolph, his replacement, was on the sideline after suffering a concussion a week earlier on a hit by Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas that put the brutality of football, even in its current safety-enhanced version, on vivid display.\n\nSo the Steelers were on the road (allegedly) with a rookie third-string quarterback making his first NFL start as they attempted to keep their record from plummeting to 1-5.\n\nNo problem, as it turned out.\n\nHodges gave a solid performance. Bush, a dynamic rookie linebacker, and Conner, the third-year tailback who was a Pro Bowl selection last season while Bell sat out in a contract dispute, more than did their parts. The Steelers raced to an early lead and held on late.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt calm, cool and collected,\u201d Hodges told NBC after the game. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple plays I wish I had back. The interception, I wish I could take back. But at the end of the day, we got the win. And that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nSteelers fans were waving their Terrible Towels as they took over the cozy Dignity Health Sports Park. They watched the Steelers seize a 14-0 advantage in the first quarter as Bush, the 10th overall selection in this year\u2019s NFL draft out of Michigan, scored a touchdown after picking up the ball off the turf on a backward pass by Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, then set up a touchdown with a tipped-ball interception.\n\nHodges is a far lower-profile NFL newcomer, as an undrafted rookie out of Samford playing only because of the injuries to Roethlisberger and Rudolph. But he threw for more than 14,500 yards in college and broke Steve McNair\u2019s FCS record for career passing yards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe received more pregame attention for being a champion duck-caller given the nickname, naturally, of \u201cDuck.\u201d But he was poised in the pocket and accurate with his throws Sunday in a 15-for-20, 132-yard passing performance. He threw a touchdown pass to Conner and played mistake-free football until a fourth-quarter interception. The Steelers took a decidedly low-risk approach with him.\n\n\u201cMy mind-set going into the game, with it being Duck\u2019s first start, was I just had to up my level of play to try to make the game as easy as possible for him,\u201d Conner said on NBC afterward. \u201cWe had to score on defense, which we did that. I had to just play big to make the game easier for him. That\u2019s what the game plan was.\u201d\n\nConner also ran for a touchdown as the Steelers improved their record to 2-4. Rudolph presumably will regain the quarterback job from Hodges after the bye. But Tomlin now knows that he has some enviable depth at the position.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis has been a different sort of season for an organization so accustomed to stability and success. There have been reports that the Washington Redskins, after firing Jay Gruden as their coach, could make an offseason run at Tomlin.\n\nBut whether Redskins owner Daniel Snyder is an admirer of Tomlin, the Steelers\u2019 history under the ownership of the Rooney family is that they simply do not get rid of coaches. Tomlin has two seasons left on his contract after this season. The likely outcome is that Tomlin remains in Pittsburgh and the Steelers, whether they get back into playoff contention this season, retool with Roethlisberger back in the lineup next season and try to recapture their past Super Bowl success.\n\nTomlin and his staff did a masterful job Sunday making things work with Hodges. It didn\u2019t hurt that the Chargers, whose record dropped to 2-4, gave a feeble performance for three quarters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Chargers were expected to be a top AFC contender this season after reaching the playoffs last season. Now they can\u2019t even win at home against a rookie third-string quarterback. They trailed, 24-0, in the fourth quarter before finally getting going with a field goal and two touchdown passes from Rivers to tight end Hunter Henry, who was playing his first game since suffering a tibial plateau fracture in his knee in the season opener.\n\nThe Chargers, after a Steelers punt, got the ball back at their 1-yard line with 1:03 remaining and no timeouts left. Rivers threw an interception with 41 seconds to play to seal the outcome, much to the delight of the home-away-from-home crowd.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is a road game,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cI mean, Steeler Nation really came out.\u201d\n\nAnd, thanks in part to the play of Hodges, all those Steelers fans were delighted with what they saw.\n\nIn-game updates\n\n4th Quarter\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChargers make it interesting: It\u2019s probably going to be too little, too late. But the Chargers have made it interesting with 17 straight fourth-quarter points. Philip Rivers threw a second touchdown pass to tight end Hunter Henry, this time an 11-yarder. The Chargers have all three timeouts remaining and can get the ball back if they get a stop on defense. (Steelers 24, Chargers 17 with 1:29 left in the 4th quarter)\n\nTD for Chargers: The Chargers finally have reached the end zone, courtesy of a five-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to tight end Hunter Henry. Henry is playing his first game since suffering a tibial plateau fracture in his knee in the season opener. He made a nice catch in the back of the end zone and just managed to get both feet down in bounds. (Steelers 24, Chargers 10 with 7:13 left in the 4th quarter)\n\nChargers get FG: The Chargers, at least, won\u2019t be shut out. They got a 38-yard field goal by rookie kicker Chase McLaughlin a minute into the fourth quarter. (Steelers 24, Chargers 3 with 14:00 minutes left in the 4th quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n3rd Quarter\n\nBush returns to field: Rookie linebacker Devin Bush was back on the field for Pittsburgh\u2019s first defensive series of the second half. The Steelers forced a punt by the Chargers. (Steelers 24, Chargers 0 with 6:39 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nFG for Steelers: The Steelers are controlling the clock and the game. They held the ball for nearly half of the third quarter and got a 20-yard field goal by kicker Chris Boswell to up their lead to 24 points. Rookie quarterback Devlin Hodges kept his cool on a third-and-goal play from the 2-yard line when the football got past him on a low snap out of shotgun formation. Hodges ran the ball down and picked it up around the 20-yard line, then managed to run to his right and avoid an intentional grounding penalty with an incompletion on a throw out of bounds. (Steelers 24, Chargers 0 with 8:12 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nHalftime in Carson: Steelers fans, waving their Terrible Towels, have taken over the cozy Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif., the supposed home of the Chargers. And their team has given them plenty about which to cheer, with a three-touchdown lead at halftime for the Steelers. Two rookies, quarterback Devlin Hodges and linebacker Devin Bush, and third-year tailback James Conner have led the way. Bush, the 10th overall selection in the NFL draft out of Michigan, scored the Steelers\u2019 first touchdown when he picked up the football off the turf after a backward pass by Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and ran nine yards to the end zone. Bush set up the second touchdown with an interception before leaving the field later in the half with an apparent ankle or leg injury. Conner scored two touchdowns, one on a run and one on a catch of a swing pass thrown by Hodges, the undrafted rookie from Samford making his first NFL start after the Steelers lost top quarterbacks Ben Roethlisberger and Mason Rudolph to injuries. Hodges has completed eight of nine passes for 70 yards. It was a dreadful first half for the Chargers, who did next to nothing right on offense or defense and watched rookie kicker Chase McLaughlin miss a 43-yard field goal attempt when the ball clanked off the left upright. They were expected to be a top AFC contender this season after reaching the playoffs last season. Instead, the Chargers are losing at home to a rookie third-string quarterback and, barring a big second-half comeback, will see their record drop to 2-4. (Steelers 21, Chargers 0 at halftime)\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChargers miss FG: Nothing is going right for the Chargers. Rookie kicker Chase McLaughlin missed a 43-yard field goal attempt when the ball clanked off the left upright. Coach Anthony Lynn opted for the kick instead of a fourth-and-six try from the Pittsburgh 25-yard line. (Steelers 21, Chargers 0 with 32 seconds left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nDevin Bush hurt: Steelers linebacker Devin Bush left the field with an apparent ankle or leg injury. He is receiving attention on the Steelers\u2019 sideline from members of the team\u2019s medical staff. Bush has had a superb game with a touchdown on a fumble recovery and an interception to set up another touchdown.\n\nTD pass for Hodges: Devlin Hodges\u2019s first NFL touchdown pass has upped the Steelers\u2019 lead over the Chargers to 21-0. It was a 26-yarder to tailback James Conner on a swing pass to the right. The Steelers kept the ball for 14 plays and 9 minutes, 9 seconds on the drive and they\u2019re dominating the Chargers. Hodges, the undrafted rookie from Samford making his first NFL start, has completed eight of nine passes for 70 yards. (Steelers 21, Chargers 0 with 6:34 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nSteelers turn Bush interception into TD: This game has been a showcase, so far, for Steelers rookie linebacker Devin Bush. His tipped-ball interception gave the Steelers possession of the ball at the L.A. 40-yard line, and they cashed in with a 12-yard touchdown run by tailback James Conner. So Bush, the 10th overall selection in this year\u2019s NFL draft out of Michigan, has scored one Steelers\u2019 touchdown with a return of a fumble recovery and set up the other one with an interception. (Steelers 14, Chargers 0 with 4:29 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nDefensive TD for Steelers: The Steelers have an early lead thanks to a touchdown by their defense on an eyesore of a play by quarterback Philip Rivers and the Chargers. Rivers, under pass-rush pressure, tried to get the football to running back Melvin Gordon on his right. But Rivers\u2019s pass was backward and fell to the turf for what was ruled a lateral and a fumble charged to Rivers. Steelers rookie linebacker Devin Bush picked up the ball off the ground and ran nine yards for the touchdown. (Steelers 7, Chargers 0 with 10:51 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nBad first throw by Hodges: Undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges, making his first NFL start for the Steelers, had wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster open on Pittsburgh\u2019s first offensive play. But Hodges\u2019s pass was underthrown and the ball fell incomplete. Hodges did complete a third-down pass short of the first down and the Steelers punted. That came after the Chargers punted on the game\u2019s opening possession, with the many Steelers fans in the crowd in Carson, Calif., chanting for the Pittsburgh defense. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers limped a bit on his way off the field after absorbing a hit after delivering a throw on the opening series. (Steelers 0, Chargers 0 with 11:06 left in the 1st quarter)","23":"\n\nAli Reza Ataie at his home in Grand Prairie, Tex.

(Jason Oxenham\/AP)\n\nA long path to America\n\nRefugees detained on the Manus and Nauru islands weren\u2019t criminals, as Trump had assumed. But they were treated like they were, held for years amid wretched conditions as a warning to others not to follow their lead.\n\nTheir origins trace a wide swath of the globe, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Somalia and Myanmar. But they shared a common destination: Australia, where they had intended to escape from war, oppression or poverty.\n\nThe Australian government disrupted those plans in 2013, enacting a policy of forbidding asylum arrivals by sea. Instead, those arrivals were sent to Manus and Nauru \u2014 tiny islands far from Australia\u2019s mainland \u2014 and told they would never be allowed to settle in Australia.\n\nThe government insisted the policy was meant to discourage dangerous boat journeys that enriched smugglers and cost asylum seekers their lives. Human rights groups countered that it was a cruel measure fueled by xenophobia.\n\nThe policy change came as the Alis were already en route.\n\n[\u2018People just lost hope\u2019: After Australia\u2019s election, asylum seekers attempted suicide]\n\nThe pair shared much: Both were teenage, firstborn sons whose families opted to send them abroad rather than keep them in a country where they faced ethnic persecution and a war without end. But they had never met in their native Afghanistan.\n\nThey each set off alone. First to India, then Malaysia, then Indonesia. A harrowing days-long sea journey in a rusty fishing boat packed to twice its capacity brought them to Australia\u2019s Christmas Island and, they thought, their new lives.\n\nBut instead of entry to Australia, they were given a one-way ticket to Nauru \u2014 an eight-square-mile nation in the Pacific. The rocky land had been long since exhausted by strip mining, and with few other resources to offer, converted into a detention center for Australia\u2019s unwanted migrants.\n\n\u201cWe had gone through all of these countries, gone through the ocean. And then we were in prison,\u201d said Ataie, who was 15 years old when his journey began. \u201cIt was the most terrible situation of my life.\u201d\n\nDespite sweltering temperatures, the detainees were housed in overcrowded tents. They were each given two minutes to shower, and addressed by staff with an alphanumeric code, rather than their names. As desperation grew, some detainees sewed their lips shut in protest. Others committed suicide.\n\n\u201cEverything I had heard indicated that the situation was very grim,\u201d said Anne Richard, who was then the Obama administration\u2019s point person for refugee policy.\n\nAs Obama\u2019s presidency came to an end in late 2016, and as the global population of displaced people swelled to record numbers, the administration was looking for ways to accept more refugees. It also wanted to encourage other nations to do the same.\n\n[Children in Australia\u2019s offshore migrant center are so distraught, some have attempted suicide]\n\nRichard struck a deal with the Australians that fall that was intended to accomplish both: The United States would accept up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Manus if the Australians took in more people from other parts of the globe.\n\nIn Nauru, the deal offered a rare dose of hope.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I heard about it, I signed up,\u201d Hesar said.\n\nAtaie was more skeptical. He wasn\u2019t sure the United States would actually follow through.\n\nThen Trump was elected, and the transcript of his combative call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was published in The Washington Post.\n\nObama\u2019s agreement, Trump told his Australian counterpart, was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d What if the next Boston marathon bomber was among the refugees, he asked?\n\n\u201cThey are not going to be wonderful people,\u201d the president fumed before abruptly ending the call.\n\nAcross the globe, in Nauru, a familiar despair returned.\n\n\u201cI stopped dreaming about what life would look like in the United States,\u201d Ataie said.\n\nBut both Alis kept going with a process for screening refugees that Trump had dubbed \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d In interviews, every moment of their lives was reconstructed. The investigators homed in on possible inconsistencies. Medical and background checks followed.\n\nAfter more than a year, they got approval. But they still didn\u2019t know for sure that Trump would let them in.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018We\u2019re either going to be the luckiest people because we\u2019ll get out, or the unluckiest because we\u2019ll have everything done and then we\u2019ll sit in Nauru,\u2019 \u201d Ataie said.\n\n\u201cEven when they gave us a flight date, we were like, \u2018Is it going to happen?\u2019 \u201d Hesar added.\n\nOn Feb. 11 last year, they left Nauru for the first time in four years. Under intense pressure from the Australians to uphold the agreement \u2014 \u201ca deal is a deal,\u201d Turnbull had told Trump \u2014 the president had relented.\n\n\n\nRefugees on the island of Nauru in September 2018.

When Ataie gets home, he spends hours online studying for a degree in cybersecurity.\n\nNew refugee arrivals have to find a job fast because the support from the local resettlement office doesn\u2019t last long: just three months before they need to become self-sufficient.\n\n\u201cWhen they get here it\u2019s, \u2018Welcome to Dallas. Here\u2019s your welcome meal.\u2019 And the first thing they ask is, \u2018When can I start looking for work?\u2019 \u201d said Jacqueline Buzas, who coordinates refugee arrivals for the Dallas office of Refugee Services of Texas.\n\nThe newcomers from Nauru and Manus have had little apparent trouble finding jobs. Jenny Leahy, an Australian aid worker who lived on Nauru, visited dozens of them in the United States last month \u2014 from San Diego to New York. All were supporting themselves, a fact consistent with studies showing that refugees generate far more in government revenue, through employment and entrepreneurship, than they cost in state services.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hard workers, and they\u2019re the most honest, generous and considerate people you could ever hope to meet,\u201d she said as she sipped tea with the Alis at their apartment. \u201cIt breaks my heart that they\u2019re not in Australia. Who wouldn\u2019t want them as neighbors?\u201d\n\nIn the Dallas area, plenty of people do. Buzas said that even as U.S. policy moves toward a more restrictive stance toward refugees, the response in the Dallas community has trended the opposite way. \u201cI\u2019m flooded by people interested in helping,\u201d she said.\n\n[No refugees allowed? Trump\u2019s plan to give states and cities a veto prompts an outcry.]\n\nAmong those who have been inspired to assist is Walsh. As a flight attendant, she travels the world. But it\u2019s in her adopted hometown where she has forged connections with people from Congo, Iraq, Myanmar and well beyond.\n\n\u201cI put myself in their shoes: What if it were me having to go to another country because I couldn\u2019t go home?\u201d said Walsh, whose pilot husband and teenage daughter have also become avid volunteers. \u201cThey really blow me away. They can come here with nothing and rebuild their life. These are people with superpowers.\u201d\n\n\n\nAtaie, left, and Walsh wait for the arrival of a friend at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. (Sergio Flores\/for The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nAtaie embraces his friend, Jafar Alizada, who arrived in Dallas from Nauru. (Sergio Flores\/for The Washington Post)\n\nAtaie wears a shirt emblazoned with the words \u201cStraight Outta Nauru.\u201d (Sergio Flores\/for The Washington Post)\n\nShe and the Alis regularly visit each other for meals. They share holiday and birthday celebrations, along with confidences and jokes.\n\nEarly on, she offered occasional guidance \u2014 how to buy a car, where to shop. But after a while, they didn\u2019t need much help.\n\nSo when her phone rang early one spring morning, she knew something was wrong. Their apartment was flooding, they told her in a panic. She was rushing to call the plumber when they revealed their discovery of a great American tradition: \u201cApril Fool\u2019s!\u201d\n\nEven as they adapt to their new lives, their old ones retain a magnetic pull. They video-chat regularly with their families in Afghanistan, and worry about relatives left behind.\n\nWith the Trump administration admitting so few refugees \u2014 a move justified by the need to focus on asylum seekers arriving at the southern border \u2014 any prospect that their families might join them in the United States has grown more remote. And with the war still raging, a return to Afghanistan is out of the question.\n\nIn the meantime, they do what they can to keep alive their memories of home. That included a trip to an Afghan restaurant on one recent evening, their first since they left the country.\n\nSet in a lonely strip mall where Texan suburbia meets undeveloped prairie, the restaurant featured tables decorated with baseball cards and comic strips \u2014 a dash of Americana in an establishment serving up specialties from central Asia.\n\n\u201cMy mouth is watering already,\u201d said Hesar as he pored over a menu stocked with savory beef dumplings known as mantu and delicate potato-filled flatbreads called bolani.\n\n\u201cRemember when we tried to make bolani at our place?\u201d asked Ataie, laughing. \u201cWe had to take down the smoke alarms.\u201d\n\nThe pair have been teaching themselves how to cook Afghan food via YouTube videos. But they\u2019re not sure how well their training has worked.\n\nAtaie imagined how the family he hasn\u2019t seen since he was a teen might respond if he ever gets the chance to cook for them: \u201cYou\u2019ve been eating this?\u201d\n\nThe refugee population on Nauru is now dwindling, and new arrivals have slowed. But last week, one of the Alis\u2019 last friends there became the latest to land in America.\n\nWalsh brought her homemade welcome sign. Ataie wore a black T-shirt with \u201cStraight Outta Nauru\u201d emblazoned across the front. Three others who had traveled the unlikely path to Dallas, via a detour in the South Pacific, joined in.\n\nNo one mentioned the news, only hours old, that fewer refugees will be resettled in the United States next year than at any time since 1980.\n\nFor long minutes after the flight landed, there was no sign of the newcomer. But then he emerged, smiling, weary from his travels and apologizing for the delay. Jafar Alizada had gotten lost after landing, and came through the wrong door.\n\nHis friends hugged him and helped him with his bag \u2014 an average-size backpack, not even full. They had much to discuss: Alizada\u2019s journey, the latest news from Nauru, life in America. But first he needed sleep.\n\nMoving quickly, they got into their car, and sped off into the Texas night.","24":"We invite you to submit your videos, photos, articles, and comments in certain areas of our website.

He was 85.\n\nThe Russian space agency, Roscosmos, announced his death but did not cite a cause.\n\nMr. Leonov, a Soviet air force officer, was chosen in 1959 as part of his country\u2019s inaugural class of astronauts \u2014 known as cosmonauts in the old Soviet Union. At the time, the Soviets were leading the space race, a symbolic and strategic battle for technological superiority during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first satellite to orbit Earth. In April 1961, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin \u2014 a close friend of Mr. Leonov\u2019s \u2014 became the first person launched into space.\n\nAs the U.S. space program tried to catch up, with flights by Alan B. Shepard Jr. and John Glenn, the Soviets sought new ways to maintain their early edge. Mr. Leonov began training for his spacewalk in 1963.\n\nHe underwent a rigorous program of swimming and running and was subjected to long periods of weightlessness. A special suit and helmet were made to withstand the extreme conditions in space.\n\n\n\nMr. Leonov in 2015. (Vasily Maximov\/AFP\/Getty Images)\n\nAs perilous as early space travel was, it seemed doubly dangerous for a human being to \u201cwalk\u201d \u2014 or, more precisely, to float \u2014 outside the safety of the capsule. On March 18, 1965, Mr. Leonov took that step.\n\nHe left the capsule through a hatch, leaving a fellow cosmonaut, Pavel Belyayev, to pilot the ship. Mr. Leonov entered an airtight chamber called an air lock and inhaled pure oxygen for almost an hour to reduce the level of nitrogen in his blood, as a means of preventing decompression sickness, or the bends.\n\nFinally, he opened the outer hatch and entered space, more than 100 miles above the earth\u2019s surface, connected to his capsule by a 16-foot-long tether. A skilled amateur painter, Mr. Leonov found the vista \u201cindescribably beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said to myself, \u2018It\u2019s true, the Earth is round,\u2019 \u201d he later said.\n\nHis spacewalk was captured by two film cameras that produced remarkably clear images, including some in color.\n\n\u201cIt was so quiet I could even hear my heart beat,\u201d Mr. Leonov told London\u2019s Observer newspaper in 2015. \u201cI was surrounded by stars and was floating without much control. I will never forget the moment. I also felt an incredible sense of responsibility. Of course, I did not know that I was about to experience the most difficult moments of my life \u2014 getting back into the capsule.\u201d\n\nWhen he attempted to reenter the air lock leading to the space capsule, Mr. Leonov could not climb through the hatch. His spacesuit had expanded and become almost rigid.\n\n\u201cNear the end of my walk,\u201d he told the New York Times magazine in 1994, \u201cI realized that my feet had pulled out of my shoes and my hands had pulled away from my gloves. My entire suit stretched so much that my hands and feet appeared to shrink.\u201d\n\nHe decided that his only option was to open a valve to release air from inside his spacesuit. It deflated enough to allow Mr. Leonov to enter the capsule\u2019s air lock headfirst, but the change in pressure left him at risk of decompression sickness. His spacewalk lasted only 12 minutes, but his body temperature had risen so much that sweat was sloshing in the leggings of his spacesuit.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t report this down to Earth,\u201d Mr. Leonov said in 1999. \u201cI knew the situation better than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIt would be decades before the dangers he encountered were fully known. Mr. Leonov also revealed, years later, that he had a suicide pill in his helmet, in case he could not return to the spacecraft.\n\nOnce he was back inside the capsule, it began to roll uncontrollably. Oxygen levels in the cabin became dangerously high, but eventually the cosmonauts were able to stabilize the craft for its return to Earth.\n\nWhen the automated reentry system failed, Mr. Leonov and Belyayev flew their craft manually, tumbling wildly until its parachutes opened. They came to rest in a dense forest in the Ural Mountains, about 1,000 miles from their intended landing spot.\n\nSurrounded by several feet of snow, the two cosmonauts stayed in the capsule as temperatures fell below zero. It took more than two days before they were rescued by helicopter.\n\nHis feat made Mr. Leonov a national hero, and he was expected to be the first person from his country to walk on the moon. Before the United States could do so, Soviet spaceships circled the moon and landed on its surface.\n\nBut other test flights failed, and the booster rocket designed to propel the Soviets\u2019 lunar mission exploded on the launchpad. The space race was won by the United States, culminating in the Apollo 11 mission, which touched down on July 20, 1969, accompanied by astronaut Neil Armstrong\u2019s memorable words as he stepped onto the moon\u2019s Sea of Tranquility: \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d\n\nAlexei Arkhipovich Leonov was born May 30, 1934, in the Siberian village of Listvyanka. He was from a large family, and his father, a onetime coal miner and farmer, spent time in a Soviet gulag for dissent.\n\nYoung Alexei was transfixed by aviation from an early age and also studied art. He entered the Soviet air force in 1953 and trained as a fighter pilot and parachutist.\n\nIn January 1969, Mr. Leonov was in a motorcade entering the Kremlin when a man wearing a police uniform opened fire with two automatic handguns. Mr. Leonov\u2019s limousine was struck by more than a dozen shots, apparently intended for Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was in a different car. Mr. Leonov\u2019s driver was killed.\n\n\u201cI looked down and saw two bullet holes on each side of my coat where the bullets had passed through,\u201d Mr. Leonov said in 1994. \u201cA fifth bullet passed so close to my face I could feel it go by.\u201d\n\nIn 1975, Mr. Leonov returned to space as part of the first joint U.S.-Soviet space effort. His capsule docked with an Apollo spacecraft under the command of NASA astronaut Thomas P. Stafford. They shook hands through a connecting portal and became close friends.\n\n\u201cIn the eyes of all of humanity,\u201d Mr. Leonov said, \u201cwe showed the best side of man.\u201d\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Svetlana, two daughters and several grandchildren.\n\nMr. Leonov became director of the Soviet cosmonaut corps and retired in 1992. He later worked in banking and exhibited his paintings worldwide, including at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.\n\nFluent in English and fond of jokes, he was a popular speaker at gatherings of space aficionados. Author Arthur C. Clarke named a spacecraft after Mr. Leonov in his 1982 novel, \u201c2010,\u201d a sequel to \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d\n\nMr. Leonov came to regret the secrecy and suspicion surrounding the Cold War competition in space.\n\n\u201cIf we could have gotten together earlier,\u201d he said in 1990, \u201cwe would already have built an international observatory on the moon and we would be flying to Mars right now.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Soviet spacecraft obtained lunar soil samples before Apollo 11 reached the moon in 1969. The soil samples were obtained by the Soviet Union in 1970.","26":"Robert Forster, a brooding, ruggedly handsome Hollywood actor who was featured alongside Marlon Brando and Gregory Peck in the late 1960s, became a B-movie action star playing lawmen and thugs, and revived his career with an Oscar-nominated turn in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d died Oct. 11 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 78.\n\nThe cause was brain cancer, said his publicist, Kathie Berlin. Mr. Forster\u2019s death coincided with the release of his latest film, \u201cEl Camino,\u201d a spinoff of the AMC series \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d in which he played a fixer who fashions a new identity for Bryan Cranston\u2019s meth kingpin.\n\nMr. Forster began his film career as an Army private who, in \u201cReflections in a Golden Eye\u201d (1967), gallops naked through the woods atop a black stallion, catching the eye of Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. More than four decades later, he found himself promoted to general, playing a military leader in \u201cOlympus Has Fallen\u201d (2013), an action thriller about a terrorist attack on the White House.\n\nIn between came dozens of roles as cops, detectives and straight-talking heavies, in grindhouse pictures with names like \u201cScanner Cop II: Volkin\u2019s Revenge\u201d and \u201cPoint of Seduction: Body Chemistry III.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy career went upwards for about five years and then downwards for about 27 years,\u201d Mr. Forster told New York magazine in 2018, recalling his working life before \u201cJackie Brown\u201d (1997), in which he played a melancholy bail bondsman named Max Cherry. The part was written for him by Tarantino, a former video-rental clerk who had admired Mr. Forster in movies such as \u201cMedium Cool\u201d (1969), a countercultural touchstone by filmmaker Haskell Wexler, and \u201cThe Delta Force\u201d (1986), in which he played a Lebanese terrorist pursued by Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin.\n\nMr. Forster, who traced his ancestry to Italy, England and Ireland, was often cast against ethnic type, enlisted to play Native American figures or foreign despots such as Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama and Moammar Gaddafi of Libya. Reviewing \u201cDelta Force,\u201d Roger Ebert wrote that he \u201cgives a frighteningly good performance, intense and uncompromising,\u201d and kept the film \u201cfrom becoming just an action comic book.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Forster at the 2018 premiere of \u201cWhat They Had.\u201d (Mario Anzuoni\/Reuters)\n\nIn recent years he worked with directors including Alexander Payne, as George Clooney\u2019s father-in-law in \u201cThe Descendants\u201d (2011), and David Lynch, as a detective in \u201cMulholland Drive\u201d (2001) and as Sherrif Frank Truman in the 2017 Showtime revival of \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d (Mr. Forster had previously been offered the part of Truman\u2019s lawman brother, Harry, for the series\u2019 original run in the early 1990s; he turned it down because he was working on another show, and the role went to Michael Ontkean.)\n\nMr. Forster\u2019s late-career renaissance marked a return to the more artistically ambitious fare of his 1960s heyday, which began with \u201cGolden Eye\u201d (1995), directed by John Huston and adapted from a novel by Carson McCullers. Mr. Forster had never made a movie \u2014 or ridden a horse \u2014 before the film, and told the pop culture website the A.V. Club that he was handed the equivalent of a tan jockstrap for his infamous equestrian nude scene.\n\nHe ultimately tossed the cloth covering into the bushes, and recalled thinking: \u201c \u2018Bob, if you are afraid to be naked on this horse, you\u2019d better quit, because if you don\u2019t do it with full abandon, with absolute abandon, then you have no right to be an actor. You\u2019d better quit now.\u2019 And that was the moment I said to myself, \u2018All right, just go with it, Bob.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Forster appeared alongside Peck in a Western, \u201cThe Stalking Moon\u201d (1968), and beginning in 1971 played the hard-boiled lead of \u201cBanyon,\u201d an NBC detective series set in 1930s Los Angeles. The show was canceled after about a dozen episodes, kicking off Mr. Forster\u2019s self-described \u201c27-year slump\u201d \u2014 during which he starred in the short-lived police series \u201cNakia\u201d and appeared in movies such as \u201cThe Black Hole\u201d (1979), \u201cAlligator\u201d (1980) and \u201cVigilante\u201d (1982).\n\nAs acting jobs dried up, he also found work as a drama teacher and motivational speaker, urging companies, organizations and (on at least one occasion) a group of imprisoned white-collar criminals to \u201cdeliver excellence right now\u201d and \u201cnever quit.\u201d\n\n1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

And it\u2019s created a tremendous amount of good will. . . . For a guy who could not get a job just a few years ago to now have people come up to me on the street and say nice things \u2014 it\u2019s just astounding.\u201d\n\nRobert Wallace Foster Jr. was born in Rochester, N.Y., on July 13, 1941. (He later added an \u201cr\u201d to Foster after learning another actor shared his name.) His father was a Ringling Bros. elephant trainer who became an executive at a baking supply company; his mother was a homemaker.\n\nThey divorced when Mr. Forster was 8, and his mother later killed herself after Mr. Forster received his draft notice in 1966. In part, he told the New York Times, \u201cshe was hysterical about the thought of my going to Vietnam.\u201d Mr. Forster received a deferment, partly through medical statements describing the \u201cdevastating psychological effects\u201d of his mother\u2019s death.\n\nMr. Forster studied history and psychology at the University of Rochester, where he was mulling a career as a lawyer, when he spotted a young woman in a black leather raincoat. \u201cAs I was trying to think of what to say, I followed her into an auditorium,\u201d he recalled in a Rochester alumni magazine interview.\n\nStudents were auditioning for a production of \u201cBye Bye Birdie;\u201d the woman, June Provenzano, was a crew member. Mr. Forster landed a role in the chorus and fell in love with both acting and Provenzano, whom he married in 1966. They later divorced.\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1964, Mr. Forster moved to New York, starring opposite Arlene Francis in a Broadway production of \u201cMrs. Dally Has a Lover,\u201d which galvanized his acting career.\n\nHe later appeared in movies including \u201cAmerican Perfekt\u201d (1997), a thriller by director Paul Chart, and \u201cWhat They Had\u201d (2018), in what Los Angeles Times critic Gary Goldstein described as \u201ca stunning, Oscar-worthy turn as a man struggling to hold onto a blissful past to ward off a frightening future.\u201d\n\nHis second marriage, to Zivia Forster, also ended in divorce. Survivors include his partner of 16 years, Denise Grayson; a son from a relationship, Bobby Forster; three daughters from his first marriage, Elizabeth Foster Howell, Maeghen Perry Dimperio and Kate Forster Simmons; and four grandchildren.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Forster rarely shied away from discussing the fallow period in the middle of his career, and the toll it took on him and his family. \u201cEvery time it reached a lower level I thought I could tolerate, it dropped some more, and then some more,\u201d he told the Chicago Tribune last year. \u201cNear the end I had no agent, no manager, no lawyer, no nothing. I was taking whatever fell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cyou know what,\u201d he added, \u201ceverything teaches you something. The job of real life is the job of caring for others. Everything you do in life is superfluous compared to that.\u201d","27":"Published: July 1, 2014.\n\nThese Terms of Service (\u201cTerms\u201d) apply when you use a website, mobile application, or other online service (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d) that links or refers to the Terms.

They\u2019ve also reconfigured the old galleries and reinstalled the permanent collection.\n\nAll this growth has come at a cost. When the museum was founded in 1929, it put forth a militant face, arguing by example for a modernist view of the world that eventually encompassed art, architecture and design. But it was always an establishment property, loyal to wealth and wealthy donors, and though the public embraced it, the museum often did things that felt like a betrayal of its larger, public mission. It became a bastion of exclusion, and artists and curators who were not welcome there often worked and organized in opposition to what MoMA stood for, pushing the art world forward even as one of its greatest \u201cmodern\u201d institutions held things back.\n\nWhen the latest plans for expansion were unveiled in 2014, MoMA announced it would demolish the former American Folk Art Museum, which it had acquired, designed by the respected firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects (the same group that is working on the design of the Barack Obama presidential center in Chicago). Protest was vigorous but to no avail. MoMA gets what MoMA wants, and a perfectly good building was destroyed to make room for a purpose-built structure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVisitors to the new campus will be happy for the extra space and the much-improved circulation of the galleries. The expansion, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler, includes both a new building where the old Folk Art museum stood and space carved out of the dark, enormous and architecturally dispiriting condominium tower designed by Jean Nouvel at 53 W. 53rd St. (there\u2019s a penthouse apartment still available for a mere $63.8 million). Galleries now flow through all three spaces, the old building, the new one and the lower floors of the Nouvel tower.\n\nThat means there is less going up and down the escalators than was necessary in the old configuration, and there was nothing quite so depressing as the MoMA escalators. They felt tight, constrained and overcrowded, but it was always easier to take them than to wait for the elevators. If you wanted to see two shows, they were inevitably not just on different floors, but several floors apart. The intellectual energy of the galleries fizzled out in this strangely uncongenial, vertical space that was reminiscent of a shopping mall.\n\nNow, there is a second way to move between the floors: a capacious steel staircase that floats in a well-lighted column of space facing 53rd Street. That, alone, would make this renovation welcome. But the increase in gallery space also helps bring order to the collection, even as the museum works to mix things up stylistically, chronologically and across disciplinary lines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe collection is still roughly arranged by date, with the oldest work (from the late 19th century) on view on the fifth floor, mid-century work on the fourth and the newest material on the second. More gallery space means more options for dealing with light-sensitive material and film and video, which have now been thoroughly integrated into galleries. The museum has also added free galleries on the ground level, a small concession to those put off by the $25 full admission, and a welcome break from the erstwhile hermetic relationship to the street and city beyond.\n\nVisitors will enjoy all of this, as well as a new cafe with outdoor seating on the sixth floor, a new metal awning over the 53rd Street entrance, a more open and sensible ticket and entry atrium, reopened windows into the central lobby at the core of the old building, and a double-height \u201cstudio\u201d space in the new wing, for performance and installation works.\n\nThe museum has also committed to regularly rotating its permanent collection, to get more of it on view and incorporate diverse artists into what was for decades a rigidly canonical approach to display. Every six months, one-third of the collection will be switched out, with the galleries fully refreshed every 18 months.\n\nMoMA is billing these changes to the display of the art as the most significant aspect of the expansion. Not only is the museum growing, it is changing its relationship to the art, no longer insisting on a single grand narrative, no longer teaching, but simply opening itself up to exploration and discovery. \u201cThe museum is not the place where we are going to give a lesson,\u201d Christophe Cherix, chief curator of drawings and prints, told The Washington Post last summer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s radical, and to abandon the idea that the museum serves an educational function would be a disaster. But, though such language may sound good to other museum professionals, the public generally does want a lesson. And despite efforts to abandon \u201cgrand narratives,\u201d people generally revert to them, at least to provide a general intellectual skeleton on which to hang their observations and discoveries. Up on the fifth floor, the galleries aren\u2019t labeled by the old \u201cisms\u201d of art history \u2014 Fauvism, expressionism, cubism, surrealism \u2014 though the works are mostly grouped by stylistic or intellectual affinities. Ordinary visitors will probably use their handheld devices to look up and fill in the labels that have been removed, reconstructing the more linear sense of art history that the curators have attempted to dissolve.\n\nMuch of the best of MoMA\u2019s work over the past decade has been about adding to the larger narrative of modern art, discovering different \u201cmodernisms\u201d around the planet and expanding the definition of what qualifies as art. An exhibition of Tarsila do Amaral extended the drama of modernist painting into Brazil, where it flourished, while a display of the sculptures of Bodys Isek Kingelez connected an artist working in the Congo to the larger history of architecture and utopian social thinking. And it\u2019s good to see works from these artists incorporated into the display of the permanent collection.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between complicating narratives and abandoning them. MoMA seems to want to do the latter but can\u2019t quite bring itself to do so. The rough narrative in the galleries remains broadly chronological, with the stars of its collections still pretty much where you expect to find them. The danger is that the museum will end up with a two-tier system, still dependent on the iconic pieces that visitors demand to see, supplemented by the occasional guests brought in temporarily to complicate things. Even more worrisome is the stated goal of abandoning the didactic function. No one wants a cultural organization that hectors, but they do want to learn. It\u2019s a question of tone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd it\u2019s not entirely clear at whom the new installation is aimed: the ordinary visitor who is supposedly demanding to see art without any supporting intellectual apparatus or the more sophisticated audience who will understand why it\u2019s interesting to, say, hang a 1967 Faith Ringgold painting near Picasso\u2019s 1907 \u201cLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon.\u201d Some of these juxtapositions are telling and smart; others seem merely clever.\n\nNow MoMA faces the same challenge it faced before: how to manage its own success. Like widening highways, which tends to simply induce more traffic, expanding MoMA will only make it more attractive to more people. The new building may handle the crowds well for a while. But MoMA has become one of the great \u201cwinner takes all\u201d cultural institutions, and the more it grows, the more it will feel the need to keep growing. And, with that, the pressure to do the big, dumb, crowd-pleasing shows like the terrible 2015 Bjork exhibition will only increase.\n\nAt some point, if the institution is to remain genuinely relevant to the discourse of art, it will have to grapple with this cycle and interrupt it. That will mean recommitting to first principles, or at least some principles that reference not just access to art, but the actual experience of thinking about it. MoMA knows how to get people through the door, but no one seems terribly concerned with what happens when they leave. Did their eyeballs simply lounge over lots of intriguing things, or did they learn something?\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, at 11 W. 53rd St. in New York, reopens Oct. 21. moma.org.\n\nAD","29":"Two certainties about the NFL are that nothing stays the same for long and nothing is easy. One minute, the Rams were opening as a favorite in the Super Bowl, and every franchise with an opening wanted to copy their head coach. The next, they were surrender-punting their way into a muddle of NFC teams already in a scuffle for playoff contention.\n\nThe 49ers\u2019 fortunes have flipped just as radically. An also-ran all of last season after losing quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to injury, the 49ers now stand atop the NFC and look every bit the part of burgeoning power. The Rams had started to fall off the mountaintop before Sunday, but the 49ers shoved them and claimed their spot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 49ers validated their Monday night shellacking of the Cleveland Browns and cemented themselves as a legitimate Super Bowl contender. They are the NFC\u2019s lone unbeaten team, and now their 5-0 record includes a convincing victory over the defending conference champions. Kyle Shanahan has wrested the mantle of trendiest play-calling head coach from McVay.\n\nThe way Shanahan wields his running attack is sublime, but the 49ers have thrived on defense. They are simply suffocating opponents. Their years of cratering allowed them to collect a defensive line with four first-round draft picks, three of whom were selected in the top seven: Armstead, DeForest Buckner, Solomon Thomas and rookie Nick Bosa, who on Sunday repeatedly steamrolled Andrew Whitworth, one of the best left tackles in football.\n\nThe combination of the 49ers\u2019 marauding defense and Shanahan\u2019s relentless running game has worn down opponents. Do you want to see the effect of great coaching? San Francisco has outscored opponents, 86-31, in the second half, and it has not allowed a point in the second half in its past three games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 49ers, we know, are legit. But what of the Rams? The long-term smart money is that McVay will figure out their problems, even if they do run deep. Whether he can solve them soon enough in the rough-and-tumble NFC to make the playoffs, let alone defend their conference title, is a different question.\n\nThe Rams spent the past two seasons climbing to the top of the NFL and reshaping it in their image. They were both powerhouse and template.\n\nBut since they beat the New Orleans Saints in the NFC championship game, McVay\u2019s Rams \u2014 the team with the unstoppable offense, cutting-edge roster and newly extended franchise quarterback \u2014 are 3-4. If the playoffs started today, the Rams wouldn\u2019t be in them.\n\nAD\n\nIn some ways, the Rams are experiencing standard life in the NFL. The other teams\u2019 coaches live in big houses, too, and once a team finds success, opponents will find ways to attack it. Even great teams can take time to figure themselves out. The Patriots last year were 1-2 with resounding losses to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Detroit Lions. This seems like treacherous territory for the Rams. Really, it\u2019s the inevitable struggle.\n\nAD\n\nBut the Rams\u2019 problems cannot be dismissed as a Super Bowl hangover. They\u2019re more concrete than that.\n\nMcVay has been forced to reinvent the Rams\u2019 offense on the fly. Last season, they ran almost every play out of the same personnel grouping \u2014 one tight end, one running back and three wide receivers. They played offense like Greg Maddux pitched. Everything looked the same until you had to react, and then the result left you confused and defeated.\n\nAD\n\nBut several interlocking factors have stymied McVay\u2019s approach. The rushing attack that bludgeoned opponents has been diminished by Todd Gurley\u2019s knee problems. He cannot carry the same load as he did last year, and when he does play, he is not as quick or as powerful.\n\nGoff thrived on play-action passes last season. With Gurley a shell of his best self, it seems evident Gurley propped up Goff, and without him Goff has been exposed. Whether that exposure is temporary or permanent is only the most important question hanging over the Rams, who signed Goff to a four-year, $134 million contract extension just before the season.\n\nAD\n\nSunday was the ugly nadir of a tough season for Goff. He completed 13 of 24 passes for 78 yards. The 49ers harassed him all day, and the fact he took four sacks is actually testament to how well he got rid of the ball. But there can be no excuse for any quarterback throwing for 3.3 yards per attempt, let alone one installed as a clear franchise caretaker.\n\nAD\n\nGoff\u2019s contract has already had an effect on how much talent the Rams can put around him. The Rams let guard Rodger Saffold walk this offseason in free agency, and his departure has had a more significant impact than many expected. When Gurley sat out, the Rams turned to Malcolm Brown, who is not even a close approximation. The Rams loved third-round draft pick Darrell Henderson coming out of the draft, but he has contributed essentially nothing and fumbled in a key spot Sunday.\n\nAs Gurley\u2019s health has stifled his production, the rest of the league has finally started to find solutions. By playing a six-man front during the Super Bowl with a fluid combination of zone coverages behind it, the Patriots showed the best way to slow down the Rams. Every team has its own tweaks, but that is the blueprint.\n\nAD\n\nMcVay is a gifted play-caller and brilliant offensive mind, not just a coach who came up with a good scheme and has no Plan B. McVay probably will find the right countermoves to how the league has countered him. The Rams have no reason to worry that the league has caught up to McVay, because eventually he will surge back ahead.\n\nAD\n\nIn the meantime, though, the NFC is a viper pit, and the next 10 games will be a battle for the Rams to defend their NFC title.\n\nThe Rams entered Sunday with rare urgency for a 3-2 team headed into Week 6. The NFC is loaded with viable wild-card contenders, and Seattle\u2019s victory in Cleveland further cemented the NFC West as the NFL\u2019s toughest division. No matter what, the Rams would have left the game in third place in the division. They are now two games behind Seattle and 2\u00bd behind the 49ers. The loss dropped them behind the Minnesota Vikings, Seahawks and Carolina Panthers in the wild-card race, outside the playoff picture.\n\nAD\n\nWith their next three games against the Atlanta Falcons, Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers, the Rams have an opportunity to right what is haywire with their offense and solidify their shaky status in the playoff hunt.\n\nAD\n\nBy Thanksgiving, the Rams\u2019 current struggles may seem like an old story. But they will still have to contend with the 49ers. In the NFL, power can change hands fast. The 49ers have it in the NFC West, and the Rams do not.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAD","30":"The court insisted on unanimous opinions, for instance, in critical civil rights cases, such as Brown v. Board of Education, \u201cBrown II,\u201d and Cooper v. Aaron, decisions that found school segregation to be unconstitutional and ordered school districts to desegregate. It had done the same in Ex parte Quirin, a 1942 case that had upheld the government\u2019s use of a military tribunal to try eight German saboteurs caught in the United States during World War II. We know from the justices\u2019 private papers in each of these cases that it wasn\u2019t that the justices each agreed with every word of the court\u2019s opinions; they simply agreed that the cases were important enough that they shouldn\u2019t be determined by a divided vote, and that the reasoning shouldn\u2019t be called into question through separate opinions.\n\nThat principle also guided the court in 1974, when it ruled 8 to 0 (with Justice William Rehnquist recused) against President Richard Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal and ordered him to comply with a subpoena issued by the special prosecutor, in a decision written, at least publicly, by Chief Justice Warren Burger \u2014 whom Nixon himself had appointed. There was some debate within the White House over whether to comply and hand over the missing Watergate tapes, but the unanimity of the court\u2019s ruling made clear that compliance was the only available outcome. Nixon turned over the recordings, and, thanks to the public impact of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape, he resigned three weeks later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the great unanswered questions about that Nixon episode is whether the president might have been more encouraged to defy a divided Supreme Court. Imagine, for example, a 5-to-3 decision where all three of the participating justices appointed by Nixon \u2014 Burger, Harry Blackmun and Lewis Powell \u2014 had dissented. Would Nixon\u2019s political support have collapsed as quickly as it did? Would the Senate have voted to remove him if the House went on to impeach him?\n\nThat hypothetical is getting less hypothetical by the day. It looks increasingly likely that the Supreme Court will eventually be asked to resolve at least one of the many disputes in which President Trump has either ordered current or former officials to refuse to comply with congressional subpoenas or in which he is seeking to bar a third party from voluntarily complying.\n\nNot only did the White House signal last Tuesday that it will no longer cooperate with any congressional requests, but the federal appeals court in Washington ruled Friday morning that the president could not block an accounting firm from turning over records of the work it has performed on Trump\u2019s behalf \u2014 the first appellate ruling in one of these cases, setting the stage for a further appeal to the high court.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe theory on which Trump has litigated these cases \u2014 that Congress is not allowed to conduct any oversight of his conduct except through an impeachment inquiry that has been formally initiated \u2014 represents a radical departure from long-settled understandings (including substantial prior Supreme Court precedent). It turns on the idea that before Congress can pursue any such oversight, it is required to formally vote to approve an impeachment inquiry, which is something that neither the Constitution, federal statutes nor the House\u2019s own rules require. That\u2019s why the district court had ruled against the president in the accounting firm case, a decision the D.C. Circuit affirmed by a 2-to-1 vote on Friday.\n\nBut it was the vote in favor of the president in the appellate case that seems foreboding: Judge Neomi Rao, whom Trump appointed this year to fill the seat previously held by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, penned a 68-page dissent that broadly endorsed the president\u2019s core legal theory. As she wrote, \u201cImpeachment provides the exclusive method for Congress to investigate accusations of illegal conduct by impeachable officials, particularly with the aid of compulsory process.\u201d In her view, the House is only allowed to issue subpoenas related to potential misconduct by the president of the United States once it has crossed a Rubicon that no law actually creates. And although Congress identified a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d for the subpoena (a purpose the legitimacy of which Rao did not dispute), that was irrelevant because the subpoena also sought information relevant to whether the president has acted unlawfully.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that Rao is wrong (although she is). The problem is that the argument her dissent advances would previously have been seen as analytically indefensible, but now has the backing of a life-tenured Article III judge on what\u2019s often described as the nation\u2019s \u201csecond-highest\u201d court. However unsupported the logic is by the Constitution\u2019s text, American history or judicial precedent, Rao\u2019s dissent normalizes Trump\u2019s radical theory and thereby moves the Overton window, at least within conservative legal circles.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s especially significant here because it\u2019s not likely that Rao was writing to convince her colleagues; even if Trump asks the full D.C. Circuit to reconsider Friday\u2019s ruling, it\u2019s highly unlikely that a majority of the appeals court agrees with Rao\u2019s unusual claims.\n\nRather, it seems that the audience for Rao\u2019s dissent is the Supreme Court, including Justice Clarence Thomas (for whom she clerked). Indeed, feisty dissenting opinions in the courts of appeals often attract the attention of justices (and their clerks) and are sometimes even written much as advocates would write an application to the Supreme Court to take their appeal. One appellate judge has even gone so far as to coin a term for such opinions \u2014 \u201cdissentals.\u201d\n\nOf course, the justices may never reach the merits of this dispute (or any of the other subpoena cases). We\u2019re already well into the court\u2019s October 2019 term, and Trump could drag his feet on appealing Friday\u2019s ruling \u2014 effectively keeping it from being enforced while also preventing the justices from taking up the case until their October 2020 term, when a decision would likely be mooted by the intervening congressional election (which, no matter who wins, will return a different Congress as of Jan. 3, 2021) even if it isn\u2019t mooted by the result of the presidential election. But Rao\u2019s dissent certainly raises the possibility that, were the court to reach the merits of one of these cases, at least some of the justices might be similarly inclined. Now, at least, such a vote wouldn\u2019t be the first, and there\u2019s a lengthy lower court opinion on which such a vote could rely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd that conclusion, in turn, provokes an alarming question: What if Trump loses one of these cases by a 5-to-4 vote, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (about whom he has long been critical) joining the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents to produce a majority? Is it that far beyond the pale to imagine him defying a divided (as opposed to unanimous) court \u2014 especially if such a decision comes after he is reelected? And would congressional Republicans defend the court in such an instance, as opposed to the leader of their own party? If the president were to defy such a Supreme Court ruling without meaningful cost, it\u2019s not hard to see how much damage that would inflict upon the court\u2019s institutional authority, if not on the rule of law more generally.\n\nThere are certainly those who think we are already in the midst of a constitutional crisis. But Friday\u2019s ruling provides an ominous harbinger of what might be the real constitutional crisis to come.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD","31":"\n\nPresident Trump spoke at the Values Voter Summit in Washington on Oct. 12. (Manuel Balce Ceneta\/AP)\n\nThe timeline isn\u2019t complicated. Responding to news reports about President Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that her party was initiating an impeachment inquiry in the House. The following day, Sept. 25, the White House released a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, which demonstrated that Trump had, in fact, asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. The next day, the White House released the complaint written by an intelligence community whistleblower that contextualized Trump\u2019s requests in the broader context of how the president and his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani were trying to get Ukraine to act against Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s proved to be difficult for Trump to argue that his actions were appropriate. Instead, he and his allies have tried to argue around the edges, criticizing how the whistleblower filed his complaint or how the Democrats are conducting the impeachment probe instead of defending Trump\u2019s actions on the merits.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has gone further, misrepresenting how Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) came to criticize Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. It\u2019s a remarkable glimpse at how Trump tries to shift reality in front of our eyes, but also a good example of how hard it can be to suss out the line between a mistake and a lie.\n\nOn Sept. 26, the day after the rough transcript was released, Schiff offered a paraphrase of its contents during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee, of which he serves as chair. The paraphrasing cast Trump\u2019s call in a deliberately negative light, with CNN\u2019s fact-checker Daniel Dale writing that Schiff \u201cdid make it easy for viewers to get confused\u201d about what Trump had actually said.\n\nIn short order, Trump seized on Schiff\u2019s depiction of the call as problematic to the point of criminality. This is standard operating procedure for a guy who spent decades in New York real estate, inflating everything to its extreme. But over time, as Dale noted on Sunday, it also led Trump to reorder history to try to make Schiff look even more dishonest than Trump\u2019s misrepresentations.\n\nHe got there in three steps.\n\nStep 1: Trump says Schiff lied about the call and got caught.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam B. Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Trump tweeted on the day after Schiff\u2019s committee hearing. \u201cHe was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT.\u201d\n\nHe \u201cgot caught\u201d in the sense that, during the hearing, Schiff was called out by Republicans for the paraphrasing.\n\nOn Sept. 29, Trump escalated his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cSchiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\u201d\n\nNotice, though, that Trump is still presenting the timeline correctly at this point. At a swearing-in ceremony for Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, Trump presented Schiff's actions in the proper order.\n\n\u201cWhen he saw my call to the President of Ukraine, it was so good that he couldn't quote from it because it \u2014 there was nothing done wrong,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was perfect. So Adam B. Schiff decided, 'I can't let this happen, so let me make up.'\"\n\nHe repeated a similar complaint the following day.\n\nMind you, Trump\u2019s complaints are not without some irony. \u201cAdam B. Schiff \u2026 made up my words, which I think is just a horrible,\u201d Trump said during that same event. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen a thing like that.\u201d\n\n2. Trump claims Schiff and Pelosi were somehow caught by the transcript of the call.\n\nIn a tweet on Oct. 5, Trump for the first time blurs the timeline of events.\n\nThe so-called Whistleblower\u2019s account of my perfect phone call is \u201cway off,\u201d not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nTrump has argued that Pelosi\u2019s call for impeachment was hobbled by his release of the transcript, which is not a view shared by Pelosi or many other observers. Trump is likely tying Schiff and Pelosi together here solely to taint Schiff through association with the unpopular-with-Republicans Pelosi. But we see the rough outline of a more nefarious and more explicitly false accusation: that Schiff\u2019s paraphrasing was uncovered by the release of the transcript.\n\nThe following day, Trump tweeted that both Pelosi and Schiff were guilty of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason\u201d and that they should \u201cbe immediately Impeached!\u201d These are ridiculous assertions for a number of reasons, but it shows both the fervor of Trump\u2019s efforts to strike back at his opponents and his disinterest in accuracy while doing so.\n\n3. He claims that Schiff\u2019s misrepresentation of the call was exposed when Trump released the transcript.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Trump for the first time inverted the order of what happened.\n\n\u201cI had a perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine \u2014 like, I mean perfect,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople read it, but they don't read that. They heard Schiff's version of it. He defrauded the American public. He gave the most horrible rendition, adding his own words.\u201d He took a quick aside to note that no one had ever seen anything like it.\n\n\u201cHe made it up,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cBecause what happened is they spoke about a day too early.\"\n\nThe \u201cthey\u201d here still seems like Trump may be lumping Schiff together with Pelosi, but the implication is clear: Schiff made up what Trump's call said \u2014 but he spoke too early in doing so.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before leaving the White House for a political rally in Minnesota on Oct. 10, Trump made his first explicit assertion that Schiff had presented his paraphrasing before the transcript was released.\n\n\u201cI will say this: Adam B. Schiff took that conversation before he saw it and fabricated a conversation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me, that's criminal. What he did is criminal.\"\n\nAt the rally, Trump was back to the proper order \u2014 before again blurring what happened.\n\n\u201cSo we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that crooked Adam B. Schiff, this guy is crooked. He had to make up a fake conversation that never happened and he delivered to the United States Congress and the American people,\u201d Trump said. He went on to criticize Pelosi for defending Schiff\u2019s comments in an interview with ABC News.\n\n\u201cThese people are sick,\u201d he said of Pelosi and Schiff. \u201cI\u2019m telling you they\u2019re sick, and you know what? Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word, and it would have been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early. They said all these horrible things. Do you know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters the following day, he was back to the correct order of events.\n\n\u201cSchiff made up a story,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when Schiff read what I actually said, he said, \u2018I can\u2019t say this because he did nothing wrong.\u2019 So Schiff went out, and he made up a lie.\u201d\n\nBut at the Value Voters Summit on Saturday, Trump again suggested that Schiff was busted by the transcript.\n\n\u201cHe made up a phone call, but then I did something that they didn't expect,\u201d Trump said of Schiff. \u201cI immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives \u2026 I got approval to immediately make that call public.\"\n\nThat's not true, but on Monday morning he reiterated that order.\n\n....Democrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript, and when Ukrainian President and the Foreign Minister said there was NO PRESSURE, very normal talk! A total Impeachment Scam! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nThe implication \u2014 if not the specific wording \u2014 is that the transcript caught Schiff, which it didn't.\n\nThere's an objective reality here. Schiff's representation of what Trump said on the call came only after the transcript was already out. Trump is clearly hoping to convince listeners that the timeline was reversed, changing Schiff's paraphrasing from something misleading into something nefarious and changing Trump's response from one of frustration to one of cleverness.\n\nIt's fair to wonder, though, the extent to which the timeline has actually become muddied. At times Trump conveys events properly, albeit with a hyperbolic response. At times he conflates Schiff and Pelosi. At times he presents Schiff as having been caught red-handed.\n\nWhich one Trump actually believes isn't clear. It probably doesn't matter. His strategy is often simply to generate enough reasonable doubt about a subject that his supporters and Americans more broadly simply throw up their hands in exasperation about knowing what actually happened. Here, though, it's not complicated.\n\nTrump said something else revealing at the Value Voters Summit on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey're of the opinion,\u201d he said of Schiff and Pelosi \u2014 \u201cjust keep saying it, saying it, saying it, maybe someday they'll believe it.\"\n\n\u201cAnd frankly if I weren\u2019t there, because I was incredulous. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI heard it, I said, that\u2019s not what I said. He made up a conversation, and it was vicious what he said. And then we caught him.\u201d\n\nIf he just keeps saying it, saying it, saying it, maybe someday the public will believe it.","32":"When I had agreed to foster this homeless canine family, I\u2019d pictured a merrier scene \u2014 visions of puppies dancing like sugar plums in my head, perhaps. I hadn\u2019t thought out any snappish worst-case scenarios like this one.\n\nA favorite pet rescue group in Montgomery County, PetConnect Rescue, had put out a plea on social media: If someone could foster this mom and her pups, they could pull her out of the crowded, high-kill shelter where they\u2019d been abandoned. Their alternate ending was grim.\n\nAt the pickup location, I saw something of myself in the worn-down dog\u2019s eyes \u2014 perhaps the universal struggle of motherhood. My present challenge involved a teen rough patch. Hers involved being dumped in a crowded shelter with a litter of puppies less than 24 hours old.\n\nWhen I had broached the idea of fostering to my husband a few days before, I hadn\u2019t expected him to think it was a good idea. The rough patch had left us both raw. Short fuses were set like traps around the house. Doors slammed. Voices raised. Much to my surprise, he agreed to my scheme.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI was new to fostering. A PetConnect volunteer helped me set up the nursery that first day. Outside of her crate for the first time, the bony mother dog accepted a liver treat from my hand. I scooped kibble and mixed it with canned food and bone broth. Her puppies, more like hamsters, piled on a plush bed.\n\nI sat on the floor after taking the mother dog for a walk that night. She wagged her tail, and though she didn\u2019t trust me enough to sit next to me, she leaned toward me as if she wanted to. The next day, we repeated the routine. She put a paw on my leg when I sat on the floor.\n\nShe let us help her. The boys gave her treats and took her for walks. They cradled the fragile 2\u00bd-week-old puppies while I replaced wet bedding and made their mom her kibble and broth.\n\nAD\n\nAs she softened, so did our relationship with our sons. Night after night, instead of splitting off to our own corners, we humans lounged on the basement floor, admiring the puppies, observing their toothless gums, naming them and renaming them. The boys made a guide to tell them apart, listing names next to notes such as \u201cpink on half of nose\u201d and \u201cwhite heart on neck.\u201d They gently weighed each tiny puppy daily on an infant scale. We named the mom Fifi because she reminded us of Ruffina, a friend\u2019s dog who had died. My own dog, a German shepherd named Tabby, spied on the operation from upstairs.\n\nAD\n\nOn day four, Fifi, appearing slightly less gaunt, sat in my lap as if we were old friends. The puppies nursed with greed and had also gained weight. By the end of the first week, Fifi would continue nursing when I opened the door instead of jumping up in alarm. On day 10, she played with her puppies in front of me, throwing toys in the air, chasing balls and racing around the basement. Fifi\u2019s lackluster coat brightened to a beautiful fawn color. Her tail beat a happy rhythm. Her soft expression mirrored the softness I\u2019d started to see on my boys\u2019 faces.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the pups\u2019 timid play turned wild. We began daily outings into our fenced yard. The dogs discovered cool spring grass and puddles. They played chase and gnawed on a discarded, dried-up Christmas tree that scented their puppy breath with pine. Every evening ended with a perfect puppy pile.\n\nAD\n\nIt was a blissful time. Friends helped with walks for Fifi and donated dog toys and stacks of newspaper. Neighbors hung over the fence to chat and watch the puppies play. One curmudgeonly neighbor visited more than anyone for puppy snuggles while at the same time complaining nonstop about my time investment. Commuters on passing buses strained to catch a glimpse. Some got off a stop early to take part in our puppy parties. Bus drivers pulled over, pushing open their doors and holding up traffic on our corner to ask how to adopt. Eager teen visitors, having arrived on foot or on bikes hastily thrown down, miraculously ignored their phones for unprecedented periods.\n\nAD\n\nAnd it was blissful for other reasons: We watched as the boys seemed to forget their complaints and aggravations with us and each other. We had something consuming and constant to talk about that didn\u2019t have to do with homework or their behavior.\n\nThe first adoption application rolled in \u2014 for the male puppy my 12-year-old son called Slipper on account of his white feet \u2014 when the litter was eight weeks old. We cringed in horror and then, selfishly, decided to adopt him ourselves. But we had to let the rest go. One by one, Slipper\u2019s siblings got wonderful homes. Carl became Bailey and moved to Springfield. Rex went home with a family who had an RV and puppy-friendly camping adventures lined up for the summer. The girls \u2014 Ava, Lola and Zoey \u2014 all went to homes with kids to love. Fifi (a puppy herself at about 18 months old) found a forever home in the Virginia countryside where she has room to run. She also helps her owner, a PetConnect volunteer, care for and socialize homeless foster dogs and puppies.\n\nAD\n\nThey all went on to solid happily-ever-afters. Still, I cried when each one left. Neighbors comment on how big Slipper has grown now that he\u2019s seven months old. Sometimes I think I see a bus driver slowing down to look for puppies in the yard.\n\nAD\n\nSlipper continues to brings smiles to everyone he meets. Is it because he\u2019s grateful? I\u2019m not sure. But I\u2019m grateful for the limitless happiness he spreads in our house. This sugar plum pays his good fortune forward every day with whipping full-body tail wags, snuggles and clownish antics that make our house merry again. Next spring, he\u2019ll take a test for certification as a volunteer therapy dog to spread his magic to kids in schools and hospitals, like Tabby does.\n\nThe puppies forced our family into much-needed moments of mindfulness. What else could we be but present when there\u2019s a litter of newborn puppies in the house? We needed that family project \u2014 a happiness project, a compassion and kindness project, a put-down-our-phones project, a rush-home-to-be-part-of-it project \u2014 a way out of the pit of tension we\u2019d been stuck in.\n\nAD\n\nFostering required much time and effort, there\u2019s no denying that. But making room for Slipper and his family\u2019s kind of joy? I\u2019m not sure anything has been easier, or more worthwhile.\n\nKitson Jazynka is a Washington writer.\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.

Throw high altitude into the mix, and it\u2019s a whole new set of challenges.\n\nWhen we recently launched our Baking Basics newsletter, written by cookbook author and blogger Joy Wilson (a.k.a. Joy the Baker), we anticipated getting plenty of questions. We didn\u2019t anticipate so many about adapting the recipes to above sea level.\n\n[Get Voraciously\u2019s Baking Basics newsletter and learn the techniques that make baking a piece of cake]\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily surprise Nicole Hampton, who grew up in Colorado, went to college in Boston and returned to a pile of baking frustrations. \u201cWhen I came home, I was like, \u2018Oh, cool, nothing works now,\u2019 \u201d she says. Part of the impetus of her blog, Dough-Eyed, was to help her and other home cooks figure out how to work around the kinds of tricks high-altitude baking can play. Here\u2019s a guide to understanding why they happen and what to do about it.\n\nThe science. According to the Colorado State University Extension, the lower pressure at high altitudes has two major effects that can wreak havoc on baked goods. One, liquids evaporate faster and boil at a lower temperature. Two, the gases produced by leaveners (yeast, baking soda, baking powder) expand faster. Air at higher altitudes tends to be drier as well, so problems can begin even before you start cooking. Moreover, CSU says, \u201cfood tends to taste blander at higher elevations\u201d \u2014 see the more extreme example of terrible-tasting airline food.\n\nDon\u2019t give up. All that being said, don\u2019t assume your sea-level recipe will fail at a high altitude. CSU suggests trying a recipe first as written. Otherwise, how will you know what to tweak? Then you can begin manipulating one element at a time so you can keep track of what changes are causing which effects.\n\nAnother wrinkle is that even if you\u2019ve acquired a high-altitude-friendly recipe, it might not be right for your altitude, as all the effects amplify the higher you go. King Arthur Flour says microclimates in the mountains can mean even something that worked for your friend down the road might not work for you.\n\nThe keys are patience, meticulous testing and, yes, accepting that you might not succeed at first. \u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating. I can\u2019t possibly count the times that I\u2019ve made a recipe and had it fail,\u201d Hampton says. Even now, after years blogging and writing a cookbook called \u201cSugar High\u201d on the topic, \u201cit\u2019s tough to make the adjustment. It\u2019s a process.\u201d Still, the more you bake and the more recipes you perfect, the easier it will be.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick for The Washington Post)\n\nGeneral advice. Soon you\u2019ll understand what types of alterations work in your recipes in your kitchen. Hampton almost always starts any recipe by slightly reducing the leavener, since overexpansion is a fairly predictable outcome. Some sources recommend increasing the oven temperature by as much as 25 degrees and then reducing the baking time, the theory being that it will help the faster-rising baked goods set before they can collapse. Hampton, though, prefers to make other adjustments, because she has found that messing with the temperature can adversely affect texture. Whether you go that route is up to you, and probably the individual recipe.\n\nCSU offers a few other universal tips. One is to consider switching to a higher-protein flour, which strengthens structure. All-purpose flours can vary, so if you\u2019re using a brand on the lower end of the spectrum, such as Pillsbury or Gold Medal, considering switching to one with more protein, such as King Arthur Flour. Using extra-large eggs instead of large eggs can account for the drier atmosphere. You may find yourself needing to cut back fat and sugar since they become more concentrated at high altitude with the more aggressive evaporation of liquids.\n\n[How to choose the right flour for the right baking recipe]\n\nGiven all the variations I\u2019ve discussed so far, it can be hard to rely on specific adjustments that will apply across the board. However, CSU suggests some guidelines for cakes, quick breads and muffins to keep in mind as you experiment. For all altitudes, add up to 2 tablespoons more flour per cup called for in the recipe. For each cup of sugar, cup of liquid and teaspoon of baking powder or baking soda in the recipe (keep in mind that larger\/more eggs can serve as liquid, too):\n\n3,500 to 6,500 feet: Reduce sugar up to 1 tablespoon, increase liquid 1 to 2 tablespoons, reduce baking powder\/soda 1\/8 teaspoon.\n\n6,500 to 8,500 feet: Reduce sugar up to 2 tablespoons, increase liquid 2 to 4 tablespoons, reduce baking powder\/soda 1\/8 to 1\/4 teaspoon.\n\n8,500 to 10,000 feet: Reduce sugar 1 to 3 tablespoons, increase liquid 3 to 4 tablespoons, reduce baking powder\/soda 1\/4 teaspoon.\n\nAnother option: If a recipe uses both baking soda and baking powder in conjunction with something acidic such as buttermilk or sour cream, KAF says you can try switching to just baking powder and regular milk, for a less powerful rising reaction.\n\n[Five tips to make you a better baker]\n\n\n\n(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nSpecifics. How do you tackle different types of baked goods? Read on.\n\nCookies: Hampton says these are the least affected by high altitude. They\u2019re small and cook quickly anyway. Often you can get away with very minor tweaks, and sometimes none at all. Consider slightly cutting the leavening. If the cookies spread too much, reduce the fat and sugar a little. If the dough seems too dry, add a bit more liquid.\n\nCakes: They\u2019re a bigger endeavor, according to Hampton, as getting the rise and structure correct is crucial to a cake that does not sink. Try making adjustments based on the suggestions above. As an example, for a two-layer, 8-inch cake, Hampton typically starts by adding 1\/4 cup more flour to help with structure and 2 tablespoons liquid to account for the extra flour and drier air. For cakes that rely on beaten eggs (such as angel food or sponge), CSU says underbeating the eggs is important for keeping the cells formed by the air incorporated in the process from collapsing.\n\nPie crusts: Not too much to worry about here. All you may have to do is add a little extra water to the dough, in which case CSU suggests baking in the lower third of the oven to prevent a soggy crust.\n\nBiscuits, muffins and quick breads: CSU says these are usually sturdy enough to hold up even in a lower-pressure environment. If your baked good tastes slightly metallic or bitter, it may be because the baking soda or powder was not fully neutralized, so you\u2019d want to reduce the amount. For more delicate quick breads, they may have to be treated and adjusted like cake.\n\nBread: Yeasted breads are by far the hardest recipes to adapt. You\u2019ll want to disregard time suggestions on rising time, Hampton says, because the dough will poof up much faster. The problem with dough that has been proofed too much is that it is prone to collapse in baking. She often doesn\u2019t let it double in bulk either, assuming there will still be plenty of expansion in the oven. KAF suggests reducing the amount of yeast by 25 percent to prevent excessive rising. The problem with reducing yeast and rise time is that it can also reduce flavor. But you have a few options. Hampton likes to let dough rise in the fridge, which slows the rise but still allows for flavor development. And while many recipes call for one first rise, followed by punching down and shaping, KAF says you can do two initial rises, punching down the dough twice, so that you get flavor but not as much volume. Adding sourdough starter can help, too.\n\nOther tips. Hampton find that flavors don\u2019t come through quite as well up high, so she tends to amp up some ingredients to make them pop \u2014 using a little more vanilla extract or Dutch-process cocoa powder instead of natural. Instant espresso powder contributes depth to chocolate baked goods (this applies at sea level as well). CSU suggests adding extra spices above 7,000 feet to fix bland-tasting food.\n\nPaying attention to visual cues in recipes is especially important since the time will likely change. Are the cookies golden? Does the cake spring back to the touch? Did a tester come out of the muffin clean? Trust what you see, as well as your instincts, and soon you\u2019ll be living \u2014 and baking \u2014 the high-altitude life.

(Eric Risberg\/AP)\n\nLawmakers seeking to overhaul Silicon Valley's prized legal shield are getting more ammunition.\n\nFair-housing advocates are accusing Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms of abusing the legal provision that grants tech companies broad immunity for content people post on its platforms. They want Congress to ensure online rental services cannot ignore \u2014 and profit off\u2014 listings that violate state and local housing laws.\n\n\u201cThese companies are knowingly facilitating and profiting from illegal listings all-the-while driving up the cost and access to housing and they must be held accountable,\u201d the groups wrote to members of Congress last week.\n\nMost of the debate over Congress reviewing of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has focused on social media companies: Republicans argue they're using the law to unfairly silence conservative voices and Democrats say the act should be changed to ensure social media giants take greater responsibility for disinformation and other problematic content.\n\nBut this latest attack, coming just days before a House Energy and Commerce joint subcommittee hearing to examine the decades-old law, shows that changes could have consequences for other tech platforms such as online marketplaces.\n\nThe groups, led by the progressive group American Family Voices, are urging Congress to pass the Protecting Local Authority and Neighborhoods Act, which would clarify the law\u2019s application in this case \u2014 and make Airbnb responsible for illegal listings posted on its site.\n\n\u201cThe Airbnb model essentially says, we don't care whether your vacation rental is illegal, we don't care whether your vacation rental is disrupting neighborhoods, we don't care if your vacation rental is jacking up housing prices and removing inventory from the local community,\u201d said Rep. Ed Case (D-Hawaii), a former hotel executive who introduced the PLAN Act, which is being considered by the full committee. \u201cThat model has had serious negative effects on communities across the country.\u201d\n\nBut Airbnb says the bill is nothing more than a ploy by the hotel lobby to stifle competition and that it \u201cknowingly ignores\u201d the company's record of reaching compromises with cities to enforce short-term rental rules and collect taxes.\n\n\u201cThe protections and authority provided by [Section 230] make it possible for 7 million listings to operate on the Airbnb marketplace, fueling innovation and competition that benefits consumers to the tune of 2 million stays a night globally,\u201d Airbnb spokeswoman Molly Weedn wrote in a statement, adding that the company partners with more than 500 local governments and organizations around the world. \u201cFurthermore, CDA 230 ensures Airbnb is able to screen content and block objectionable material.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Reddit \u2014 whose representatives will testify at Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 and other companies have also long pointed to Section 230 as essential to their ability to moderate content.\n\nBut the situation is even more complicated for online marketplaces such as Airbnb and even eBay, which argue that the immunity exempts them from being held liable for transactions by their users that violate state and local laws.\n\nAirbnb has put this defense to the test, with mixed results. The company sued both Santa Monica, Calif., and Boston over regulations that compelled the company to enforce and monitor illegal listings.\n\nAirbnb settled with Boston last month in a compromise that required residents seeking to rent their properties to prove they had permission to do so from the city, and for the company to develop stronger channels for the city to notify Airbnb of illegal listings. It reached a similar compromise with the city of Portland, Ore., in September.\n\nBut in Santa Monica a federal judge sided with the city, ruling in March that while the content of Airbnb listings are protected by Section 230, any illegal activity facilitated \u2014 in this case, a violation of a short-term rentals law \u2014 was not. Last week the same court upheld the ruling in another challenge against the Santa Monica ordinance brought by an Airbnb host.\n\nSome lawyers say this shows the PLAN Act is unnecessary. Cities and states have demonstrated that they can rein in short-term rentals and come up with compromises through existing legal channels, argues Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman.\n\nAnd putting in place specific carve-outs to Section 230 would make it more difficult for tech companies, including Airbnb, to take down harmful or illegal content at will, he says.\n\n\u201cEach hole in Section 230 creates its own challenge to the integrity of Section 230,\u201d Goldman says.\n\nBut not all legal experts agree that allowing the conflicts between cities and Airbnb to play out in court is the solution.\n\nAbbey Stemler, an assistant professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University who wrote an amicus brief for Santa Monica in the 9th Circuit case, said Airbnb\u2019s use of Section 230 \u201cstretched beyond recognition\u201d of the original intent of the law.\n\nWhile Stemler expressed concerns about the PLAN Act specifically as the solution, she said that Congress could do more to clarify the intent of the law.\n\n\u201cI definitely think that the court system is too slow. Lawmakers have a better chance of deterring the harmful market failures associated with these platforms,\u201d Stemler says. \u201cIf the platform is making money off something illegal, then it should be pretty simple to hold the platforms accountable for it.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.

(Moises Castillo\/AP)\n\nLiz Ellis is an assistant professor of history at New York University and a citizen of the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.\n\nToday more than 100 cities, including Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Santa Fe will commemorate Indigenous People\u2019s Day with celebrations of their vibrant, contemporary Native communities and their heritage.\n\nThis celebration of Indigenous People\u2019s Day rather than Columbus Day has been decades in the making. Throughout most of the 20th century, U.S. schoolchildren were taught that Christopher Columbus \u201cdiscovered\u201d America. However, in the 1990s a broad coalition of artists, activists, educators and Native Americans began to contest this narrative of European triumph. They advocated for an end to the commemoration of Columbus\u2019 arrival and atrocities that his expedition committed against Caribbean Indigenous peoples, and instead for recognition of the cultural and historical contributions of America\u2019s Native peoples.\n\nThese are critically important steps in decolonizing this holiday, but we need to think bigger. The importance of Indigenous People\u2019s Day has always been rooted in the concept of visibility: reclaiming Native history and exposing historical injustices. This year we should recognize this holiday by demanding justice for Native people at the United States border.\n\nThis day of recognition is a critical component of the broader fight for justice in Native American communities. So many stories of our nation\u2019s origins present Native peoples as elements of a distant past, as though they were destined to fade into extinction. The combination of these national narratives of Native disappearance, along with the ubiquitous and stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans means that Indigenous people and communities are frequently rendered invisible.\n\nThe same thing has happened with Mayan, Lenca, Nahua-Pipil and other migrants from Central America. Narratives about their migration to the United States as \u201cinvasion\u201d obscures the fact that many refugees and migrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and elsewhere, are also Native Americans. As such their connections and claims to this land predate many of our own.\n\nFor thousands of years before the creation of the United States and Mexico, Native people traded, traveled and lived across the lands where the international border between these two countries now stands. When the Spanish arrived on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in the early 16th century, Aztec trade routes extended as far south as Nicaragua today and north into what is now New Mexico, connecting the peoples across this region. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Caddo, Comanche and Apache people built towns and economies that spread across the lands of southern Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Sonora, Chihuahua and Coahuila.\n\nIt was not until 1848, at the close of the Mexican-American war, that the modern U.S. and Mexico border was created. This imperial border, negotiated by the two states, cut right through the homelands of existing Native nations. As the United States acquired an enormous section of what had been Mexico, it did so at the expense of Indigenous communities and by disrupting centuries-long relationships linking Indigenous people, lands and neighbors.\n\nThe United States only hardened the U.S.-Mexico border in the 20th century with the creation of the Border Patrol in 1924 intent on controlling and restricting migration, mostly from Mexico. Subsequent mass deportations, including during the Great Depression, and later during Operation Wetback during the 1950s, reinforced the border further.\n\nMany Native nations have refused to recognize the United States\u2019 northern and southern borders, however, and have argued that they split existing nations apart and ignore land claims that preexisted the United States.\n\nIn the north, they met some success. For centuries, Mohawks have fought U.S. and Canadian attempts to patrol, militarize and enforce the border that bisects their homelands along the St. Lawrence and St. Regis rivers. In the 1790s, the U.S. was forced to recognize the rights of Native people to migrate because of its position of military weakness and political vulnerability. The U.S. had to negotiate both with Native nations, like the Iroquois, and the British. Many Mohawk people today reject both U.S. and Canadian citizenship and travel instead on Iroquois passports, insisting on moving freely within their ancestral lands. The rights of Indigenous peoples whose nations are currently encompassed by Canada (First Nations) actually have explicit rights to cross this border to work, visit or live in the United States.\n\nHowever, there is no comparable law or treaty that recognizes similar rights for southern Indigenous migrants. While the U.S. had negotiated a treaty in the north from a position of relative weakness, by the mid-19th century the U.S. had vastly expanded its military might, and was in the process of a genocidal campaign to remove and exterminate Indigenous peoples from lands in the Southeast and Southwest. Additionally, the development of new racial logics that excluded both Indigenous and Spanish-speaking people from participation in the American state and justified their dispossessions helped create the artificial divide between Indigenous peoples north and south of the 1848 border.\n\nDespite U.S. claims to have completely conquered Indigenous lands, the continued existence of Native nations along the southern border and their persistence as Native nations on their original homelands challenges federal claims to exclusive territory and jurisdiction in this area.\n\nAnd southern Native nations nonetheless continue to challenge the southern border and migration policies. For example, Tohono O\u2019odham, whose lands and communities straddle the U.S. and Mexico border between Arizona and Sonora, have vehemently opposed the proposed extension of the border wall through their territories. The Tohono O\u2019odham lived on these lands for thousands of the years before the birth of the United States, and the proposed expansion of the border wall constitutes a direct assault on their sovereignty in their homelands. In 2017, as the Trump administration ratcheted up its efforts, Verlon Jose, the Vice Chairman of Tohono O\u2019odham, powerfully rejected the federal governments\u2019 claims to exert their borders over his peoples\u2019 homelands. As he put it \u201cOnly over my dead body will a wall be built.\u201d\n\nAlready far too many Indigenous bodies have been sacrificed along the increasingly militarized U.S.-Mexico border. Between 2003 and 2018, 97 migrants died either in the custody of or at the hands of U.S. and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Since 1994, an estimated 8,300 people have died attempting to cross the border, and as the federal government has ramped up immigration enforcement in recent years these crossings have become more dangerous.\n\nThese dangers fall disproportionately on Indigenous people, who often face little choice but to migrate to escape state sanctioned violence and enduring discrimination in their countries. Just last year, Claudia G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, an Indigenous woman from the highlands of Guatemala, who had glossy black hair and a shy smile, was shot and killed by a CBP agent as she stood in vacant lot in Rio Bravo. In December of 2018, seven-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, whose primary language was Q\u2019eqhi, a Mayan dialect, died of dehydration and septic shock in U.S. custody, and in May 16-year-old Hernandez Vasquez, who was Maya Achi, became the fifth child to die in U.S. custody since December 2018.\n\nTo truly honor contemporary Indigenous people and dismantle the imperial legacy of Columbus, we should recognize people\u2019s human right to migrate and to move across borders that historically crossed them. People should not be detained in cages for seeking a better life, and they deserve justice. Therefore, in addition to supporting local celebrations of Native heritage and culture, we should also be supporting organizations that support the rights of Indigenous migrants and refugees like RAICES and New Sanctuary Coalition, and calling our representatives to demand political reform to protect all migrants and refugees.\n\nThis year, let\u2019s do something meaningful for the Indigenous peoples of the Americas.","36":"\n\nPresident Trump stops to talk to members of the media as he walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn at the White House on Oct. 10.

More than a dozen of the parishioners\u2019 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\n\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob. He pulls out a black gun from his jacket\u2019s inside pocket and shoots a person edited to represent late actor Peter Fonda, who was a vocal critic of the president, in the head from point-blank range.\n\nThen, chaos ensues.\n\nTrump takes down Bloomberg, Vox and \u201cFake News\u201d in quick succession before shooting Politico. At one point, he grabs someone who represents the Black Lives Matter movement in a chokehold and shoots that person in the head.\n\nAfter shooting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Vice News, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\u2019s neck.\n\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and later assaults Hillary Clinton with a gun.\n\nThe video comes to a dramatic end when Trump jams a sharp wooden stake through the head of a person whose face is a CNN logo.

Earlier this year, Cesar Sayoc, a devoted Trump supporter, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 13 pipe bombs to high-profile Democrats, several of whom were featured in the recent video, and CNN.\n\nOn Sunday, journalists and political commentators suggested the church video is further evidence that Trump\u2019s words have influenced his supporters.\n\n\u201cThis is an incitement to violence that didn\u2019t just come from the dark corners of the Internet \u2014 it was shown at a pro-Trump conference at one of his resorts,\u201d tweeted Politico reporter Andrew Desiderio. \u201cI\u2019m speechless.\u201d\n\nCNN commentator Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas wrote, \u201cTrump has legitimized hate.\u201d\n\nEnablers choose to deny it, but this is the kind of crap Trump peddles & inspires.

Griffin, shown in the video getting beheaded by the ax-wielding CNN person, tweeted that it \u201cisn\u2019t a joke\u201d to Trump supporters, adding, \u201cAnd it will not be taken as such.\"\n\nBut some pushed back against criticisms of the video, pointing out that the film\u2019s original scene, which depicted a church full of \u201cconservative Christians\u201d being killed, did not draw the same level of outcry. According to an NPR review of the movie, the fictional congregation was \u201cclearly modeled on the Westboro Baptist Church,\u201d a Kansas-based organization known for its anti-gay views.\n\nStill, others wondered if the video represents, as one person put it, \u201cthe country hitting rock bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have enough mass shootings, we have enough journalists killed in the line of duty around the world \u2014 we don\u2019t need to glorify a massacre of people who challenge Trump,\u201d Times columnist Nicholas Kristof tweeted. \u201cThis demonization of opponents and fetishization of violence is unconscionable.\u201d","37":"The plan, which would probably face substantial pushback from Republicans and corporations, is the latest flag planted by Sanders (I-Vt.) at the leftmost boundary of the Democratic field. It comes as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been siphoning support from Sanders among the party\u2019s most liberal voters, a group that belonged solely to Sanders in 2016.\n\nDemocrats at Sanders\u2019s campaign events often express approval of both his policies and Warren\u2019s, citing their similar anti-establishment views. But Warren\u2019s support has been climbing while Sanders\u2019s has been fading, and polls suggest that while the senator from Vermont is cementing support from his core followers with his purist plans, Warren may be benefiting from the perception that she is not the most radical figure in the Democratic field.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven President Trump weighed in on Sanders\u2019s predicament Friday at a rally in Louisiana, wishing him a speedy recovery while opining that if Sanders does not win the Democratic nomination most of his supporters will probably go to Warren.\n\nAs the two senators jockey for position in the Democratic field, they have been reluctant to attack each other directly for fear of alienating each other\u2019s supporters, and they often call each other friends.\n\nBut in an interview Sunday at his home in Burlington, Vt., Sanders was pressed by ABC\u2019s Jon Karl to draw a line between him and Warren, and he did so, albeit with apparent reluctance.\n\n\u201cElizabeth has said she is a capitalist through to her bones. I\u2019m not,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI am, I believe, the only candidate who is going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, \u2018Enough. Enough with your greed and your corruption.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMonday\u2019s plan is the second proposal Sanders has issued since being sidelined from the trail that seeks to cut corporate influence. The first plan targeted corporate money in politics, while the latest proposal takes a more comprehensive swing at the way corporations treat workers, pay taxes, and interact with each other.\n\nThe centerpiece of the plan aims to dramatically shift control over U.S. corporations from Wall Street shareholders to tens of millions of workers who currently have little say in the management of the companies where they work.\n\nSanders proposes forcing all publicly traded companies, as well as all private companies with more than $100 million in revenue, to give their workers at least 45 percent of the seats on their corporate boards \u2014 going further than a similar idea from Warren, who has called for giving workers 40 percent of those seats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond that, Sanders would require the companies to issue a portion of their stock holdings to a fund controlled by workers. These worker-controlled shares \u2014 Sanders calls them \u201cDemocratic Employee Ownership Funds\u201d \u2014 would give employees a percentage of the dividends paid out by the corporation.\n\nSanders takes a step beyond Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain\u2019s Labour Party, by calling for corporations to turn over at least 20 percent of their shares to these worker funds, compared to 10 percent for Corbyn. The workers would then elect a board to manage and disburse the shares.\n\nThe plan would amount to a sweeping transformation of the American economy and empower workers in a far-reaching new way. But critics say it would also give businesses an incentive to hire contractors instead of full-time employees, potentially hurting workers rather than helping them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, about 7,000 companies in the United States are set up to allow employees to own a substantial share of their businesses, representing about 11 million workers, according to Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse of Rutgers University.\n\nSanders\u2019s plan would aim to give an additional 56 million workers, in more than 22,000 companies, a share of their businesses. The campaign says workers at McDonald\u2019s, for example, would ultimately control 20 percent of its stock and 45 percent of the vote on its management decisions.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is democracy within the workplace, so the decisions aren\u2019t all being made by a tiny number of people,\u201d said Peter Gowan, a senior policy associate at the Democracy Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank, who worked with the Sanders campaign on the proposal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanders also proposes some smaller measures designed to increase worker control of the economy, such as a $500 million bank for employees who want to buy or start their own firms and the creation of \u201cworker ownership centers\u201d to help employees manage their own companies.\n\nSanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new \u201cbright line\u201d that would bar mergers of companies with too much market share. Warren has released antitrust plans related to agriculture and big tech, according to Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute, but not a comprehensive antitrust plan.\n\nSanders also proposes some smaller measures designed to increase worker control of the economy, such as a $500 million bank for employees who want to buy or start their own firms and the creation of \u201cworker ownership centers\u201d to help employees manage their own companies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new \u201cbright line\u201d that would bar mergers of companies that dominate too much market share. Warren has released antitrust plans related to agriculture and big tech, according to Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute, but not a comprehensive antitrust plan.\n\nThe plan reflects in part the battle to construct the left\u2019s agenda, as Sanders and Warren vie for liberal voters. Both candidates have come under fire from the business community for their ideas, including the criticism that they would discourage entrepreneurs from starting businesses and would prompt investors to put their money overseas.\n\nJim Kessler, senior vice president of policy at the centrist think tank Third Way, has said such plans may do little for custodial or food service workers, who are often on contract. A Sanders campaign aide has said the senator has introduced legislation to prevent misclassification of workers as contractors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlans to boost employee-owned businesses have earned some interest from lawmakers in both parties, albeit with narrower measures. Republican Sens. Pat Roberts (Kan.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.), for instance, have pushed legislation to encourage technical assistance and other help for such firms.\n\nSanders\u2019s plan would also repeal the 2017 GOP tax cut for corporations, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Many congressional Democrats also favor raising the corporate tax rate, though few want to raise it as much as Sanders.\n\nUnder his plan, America\u2019s corporate tax rate would be among the highest in the world. Corporate tax rates have fallen globally, including in the European countries often cited as a model by Sanders, with Sweden and Norway both taxing firms below 25 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe recent populist surge has prompted some in both parties to look for ways to cut the power of government and corporations. Sanders\u2019s supporters say his approach would provide much-needed influence to ordinary Americans, but conservatives argue that raising corporate taxes would ultimately hurt those same people.\n\n\u201cCorporations might write the tax check to the government, but the tax is borne by consumers, workers and shareholders,\u201d said Nicole Kaeding, vice president of policy promotion at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Raising the rate to 35 percent, she said, \u201cwould result in a smaller U.S. economy and lower wages.\u201d","38":"In my private practice as a urologist, I recently saw a 64-year-old patient who I\u2019ve been treating for several years for recurrent kidney stones. At this visit, however, she said that she now wakes up to urinate up to five times over the course of the night. The loss of sleep, she said, was causing major problems during the daytime in terms of her mood and productivity. She said she felt tired, depressed and was worried that the frequent trips to the bathroom might be a symptom of something more serious.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome urinary conditions or diseases can have multiple symptoms, one of them being nocturia, or the need to wake up several times during the night to urinate. The word nocturia comes from the Latin \u201cnox\u201d for night, and the Greek word for urine, \u201couria.\u201d\n\nNocturia is more common as we age and affects both men and women. Women can start to experience nocturia as early as age 30. Beginning in their 50s and 60s, men and women experience nocturia at the same rate, regardless of their sex.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 people experience nocturia in their lifetime, and it is normal to wake up at some point during the night to urinate. Waking up several times a night, however, can affect your quality of life and, in some cases, be indicative of another problem, or a need for certain lifestyle changes.\n\nAD\n\nIf you\u2019re waking up during the night because you\u2019re thirsty, anxious, or are in pain and also go to the bathroom \u2014 that\u2019s not the same as nocturia.\n\nAD\n\nNocturia itself is easy to diagnose because it is simply the need to wake up several times at night to urinate over a period of time (not one night where you drank a lot of liquids, for instance). Nevertheless, it is more complicated to determine why a person needs to urinate frequently during the night, and depending on the underlying cause, it can range from easy to difficult to treat.\n\nI regularly see patients with mild to major anxiety and a list of possible ailments they are worried they may have after spending a night searching their symptoms on the Internet, going down a rabbit hole of information that can be anxiety producing for someone without a medical background.\n\nAD\n\nThe causes of nocturia can include a wide variety of underlying conditions. It can be as simple as caffeine and alcohol intake, medications, sleep conditions, a urinary tract infection or complications related to diabetes. In some cases, it can be indicative of a more serious condition such as congestive heart failure, kidney failure, or a bladder, urethra or a prostate tumor, among other possibilities.\n\nAD\n\nMy 64-year-old patient ended up having a cystocele, otherwise known as a fallen or prolapsed bladder. We are now in the process of determining what is the best course of treatment for her, which can range from physical rehabilitation to surgery.\n\nNocturia can be a difficult issue to discuss because people often feel embarrassed bringing it up or are fearful of what might be wrong. While as a medical doctor I have to always consider the most serious potential causes of nocturia such as cancer or congestive heart failure, it could also be an enlarged prostate, a urinary tract infection or a symptom of a sleep condition.\n\nAD\n\nIf the nocturia is caused by an enlarged prostate, there are a variety of ways to treat the condition. I have some patients with an enlarged prostate whom I treat with medication and others who require surgery. Treatment for urinary tract infections involves medication and dietary changes.\n\nAD\n\nPhysicians walk a fine line between worrying patients unnecessarily and keeping them informed of the process of diagnosis and treatment. So, I always tell my patients that nocturia is, at a minimum, an annoyance that sometimes points to something more serious, which requires closer treatment and follow-up. Nocturia is a symptom that should not be taken lightly, but fearing the worst is a terrible reason not to see a doctor.\n\nIf you or a loved one are experiencing nocturia, I suggest seeing a urologist about the symptoms before your quality of life is affected. The physical, mental and emotional toll taken on us when we don\u2019t know what is going on with our bodies is much worse than a trip to the doctor\u2019s office to find out what\u2019s happening and what we can do about it.\n\nMarcos Del Rosario-Santiago is a urologist in the Mexican navy and a member of the American Urological Association.\n\nRead more\n\nAD","39":"For people who regularly work long hours \u2014 defined as more than 10 hours a day for at least 50 days a year \u2014 a recent study suggests an increased risk of stroke. According to research published in the American Heart Association journal Stroke, working such long hours is associated with 29 percent greater risk stroke than are those who work less. Log long hours for 10 years and the risk appeared to be rise to 45 percent more than for those who work less Previous studies have found that irregular shifts, night work and job stress can have negative health effects. In this case, the study did not consider the nature of people\u2019s work but focused instead on work duration and used data from 143,592 full-time workers. So how much should people work? The answer depends, of course, on factors that may include someone\u2019s financial situation, family needs and career goals. But to gain the psychological benefits that paid employment often brings \u2014 improved self-esteem, social networking, life satisfaction, for instance \u2014 one day a week may be enough, according to another study, published online in the journal Social Science and Medicine. Those researchers tracked 71,113 people, 16 to 64 years old, as they changed working hours over a nine-year span. They found that the risk for mental health problems fell by 30 percent when people who had been unemployed or stay-at-home parents started doing paid work for up to eight hours a week, the equivalent of one day. From a purely psychological point of view, working more hours provided no further psychological boost, the researchers found.","40":"U.S. corporate profits are stagnating due to the trade war. Lower interest rates are not going to fix this problem, which challenges markets in addition to the Federal Reserve.\n\nEquity markets have been focusing on shifts in sentiment related to the ebbs and flows of the trade war. When there\u2019s a ceasefire, equities go up. But when more tariffs or acrimony are introduced, equities go down. The trade war sentiment shifts have dominated a key fundamental market value: the stagnation of profit growth.\n\nThe Fed has its own challenges. Having cited the trade war-induced slowdown in business investment as one reason to cut rates back in July, the Fed may follow with another cut in September. But will it do any good? No.\n\nThe problem with business investment is uncertainty over tariffs and supply chains. Profit margins have been squeezed because corporations have been unable to raise prices due to fear they will lose market share. Giving the market a rate cut will not help the fundamental problem.\n\nThe impact on the U.S.\u2019s real gross domestic product has also stemmed from declining business investment. Companies\u2019 long-run business investment plans have been delayed or indefinitely postponed, and this can clearly be seen in the investment category of real GDP. This category is relatively small in its total impact on GDP; however, the U.S. economy has clearly decelerated even if a recession is unlikely.\n\nCompanies have lost pricing power.

(Delil Souleiman\/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nPresident Trump isn\u2019t the first American leader to turn his back on foreign friends who were counting on U.S. assistance: President Dwight D. Eisenhower did it in Hungary in 1956; President John F. Kennedy in Cuba in 1961; and President Gerald Ford in South Vietnam in 1975. But no previous chief executive has ever sold out the United States\u2019 allies as nonchalantly and unnecessarily as Trump has done with the Syrian Kurds.\n\nAt least with Eisenhower, Kennedy and Ford, there was a good reason they failed to come to the aid of freedom fighters: Doing so would have embroiled the United States in costly conflicts. Trump and his apologists would like to pretend that\u2019s also the case today \u2014 that Trump pulled U.S. troops out of northern Syria to avoid a war with Turkey. But there is scant chance that Turkish troops would have invaded northern Syria if U.S. troops were standing in the way. That is why President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked Trump to move the U.S. forces \u2014 and Trump, for reasons that remain mysterious, obliged. (Trump himself admitted in 2015 that \u201cI have a little conflict of interest\u201d because of two Trump Towers in Istanbul.)\n\nThe consequences of the American pullout are proving to be every bit as catastrophic as most observers \u2014 and Trump\u2019s own aides \u2014 had feared. On \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said that ever since coming to office about two months ago, he had been urging the Turks not to invade Syria. \u201cWe cited all the reasons that are now playing out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest being the likely release of ISIS fighters from these camps and prisons, not just that we see a humanitarian crisis emerging.\u201d\n\nIf Esper cited those reasons to the Turks, he surely cited them to Trump as well. But the president wasn\u2019t listening, as usual. Now Kurds are being slaughtered, and Islamic State detainees are escaping. With chaos all around, Trump had no choice on Sunday but to order most U.S. troops to scuttle out of Syria in a humiliating defeat. Our forces are leaving so fast they could not take with them, as planned, some 60 \u201chigh value\u201d Islamic State detainees \u2014 i.e., some of the worst terrorists on the planet.\n\nThe Kurds, in turn, had no choice but to invite Syrian regime forces to come to their rescue, thereby handing a massive win not only to Bashar al-Assad but also to his backers in Moscow and Tehran. The one part of Syria that had been under the control of secular moderates \u2014 the Kurds are more progressive on women\u2019s rights than anyone in the region aside from the Israelis \u2014 is now being divided between the brutal forces of Assad and Erdogan.\n\nAfter the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the presidents at the time made somber statements to explain why they did not intervene militarily and to remonstrate over the losses suffered by freedom fighters. Eisenhower, for example, said that \u201cthe United States deplores the intervention of Soviet military forces\u201d and that \u201cthe heart of America goes out to the people of Hungary.\u201d\n\nTrump did not express any such concern for the Kurds who have been fighting at America\u2019s side against the Islamic State. Instead he took a break from golf to tweet: \u201cDo you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\u201d\n\nThat Trump thinks that Iraqi troops fought Kurds in Syria \u2014 rather than around the Iraqi city of Kirkuk \u2014 shows how little he knows about this region. That he is inviting one and all to fight the Kurds (\u201cLet them!\u201d) shows how little he cares about American security, American honor or American allies. That he is now maligning his victims by claiming with no evidence that the Kurds are deliberately releasing Islamic State prisoners to force U.S. intervention shows how cruel and dishonest he is.\n\nThe Republican members of Congress who are apoplectic (\u201cShameful disaster unfolding in Syria,\u201d tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming) have no one to blame but themselves. They are the ones who continue to support a president who has been unabashed in his love of dictators, his disdain for human rights and his willingness to betray anyone or anything to advance his own interests.\n\nMost of the time, the costs of the Trump presidency are inchoate \u2014 laws are broken, norms transgressed. But when it came to immigrant children in cages or Kurds in the line of fire, the costs are all too human and horrifying. Are you happy now, Trump supporters?

Scott Applewhite, File )\n\nWill Rick Perry comply with Congress? That\u2019s the question hanging over the energy secretary now that he has been served a subpoena in the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nThree top House Democrats on Thursday officially requested Perry to turn over a trove of documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nNow Perry, who has built a reputation in Washington as one of the rare Trump Cabinet officials with whom congressional Democrats can amicably work, will have to decide whether to listen to Congress at perhaps the most trying juncture of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nPerry's decision will be an early test of how tightly President Trump is able to control his deputies from becoming witnesses in Congress's impeachment inquiry as the White House more broadly seeks to limit the information lawmakers have in their investigation.\n\nEarlier this month, Perry suggested he would go along with orders from Congress. \u201cWe're going to work with Congress and answer all their questions,\u201d Perry told reporters in Chicago on Oct. 2. An Energy Department spokesperson did not reply to requests for comment on Friday or over the weekend.\n\nBut that was before Perry was directly subpoenaed, rather than just being mentioned in subpoenas issued to the White House and to Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAnd it was before the White House issued a scorched-earth letter declaring it would refuse to cooperate with the impeachment investigation.\n\nPerry, though accused of no wrongdoing, finds himself closer to the center of a Trump scandal than ever.\n\nDuring a July 25 phone call, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into one of his political rivals, former vice president Joe Biden. Trump later said Perry asked him to make that call, but Perry told reporters last week he did it so that the two could talk about energy issues.\n\nThe four-page subpoena directs Perry to hand over documents related to his involvement in the July call as well as to a Ukrainian state-owned natural gas company. The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees have set a deadline of Oct. 18 for Perry to comply.\n\nThe subpoena from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Thursday. (AP Photo\/Jon Elswick)\n\nThere is precedent for Perry to follow if he wants follow the subpoena. The White House hasn\u2019t been able to stop some administration officials from succumbing to the pressure of legal orders from Congress.\n\nDespite a directive not to participate, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch went to Capitol Hill under subpoena on Friday. And Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, plans to testify this week under subpoena despite the State Department blocking him from previously appearing at a voluntary deposition.\n\nBy testifying or providing documents, administration officials risk having Trump fire them. But as The Post's Matt Zapotosky explains, the consequences of defying a congressional subpoena \u2014 which include fines or prison \u2014 could be seen as worse.\n\n\n\nThe Energy Department, which runs national laboratories and maintains the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile, has kept a relatively low profile during the Trump administration.\n\nPerry has been on the receiving end of a lot less criticism from Democrats compared to other Trump officials working on energy and environmental issues, such as former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and ex-Interior Department secretary Ryan Zinke.\n\nThat\u2019s not just because he's managed to avoid major ethics controversies in office. It's in part because the Energy Department has relatively fewer regulations to potentially roll back. (Though last week, a group of Senate Democrats wrote to the energy secretary urging the administration's reversal of energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs.) And it's partly because of the congeniality Perry brings to his interactions with Congress.\n\nOften Perry has assuaged fears from congressional Democrats worried about funding cut requests to the Energy Department coming from budgetary ax officials in the White House, such as current acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nDuring a hearing last year, for example, Perry heaped praise onto an energy technology incubator, popular on both sides of the aisle, for \u201chaving such a profound impact on American lives\u201d \u2014 despite the White House officially requesting to slash its budget to zero.\n\nPerry has had an easy rapport with congressional Democrats privately \u2014 sometimes bringing them in on conference calls \u2014 as well as on the dais.\n\nWhen former senator and Saturday Night Live comedian Al Franken asked Perry during his confirmation hearing whether he enjoyed meeting him in his office, Perry quipped: \u201cI hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

Malvo was convicted of capital murder in the D.C. sniper shootings but is seeking to have his life sentences revisited because he was a juvenile. (Rich Lipski\/The Washington Post)\n\nOne evening in February 2002, a 21-year-old single mother named Keenya Cook was making dinner and taking care of her 6-month-old daughter when the doorbell rang at her Tacoma, Wash., home. When Cook answered, 16-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo shot her in the face, killing her. Shortly after his first murder, Malvo threw up.\n\nHe had shot the wrong target. On orders from his mentor, John Allen Muhammad, Malvo was supposed to shoot Isa Farrington Nichols, Cook\u2019s aunt, who had supported Muhammad\u2019s ex-wife in the custody battle over their children. The slaying orphaned Cook\u2019s daughter, devastated her family and ended Nichols\u2019 marriage. But Nichols, and some other victims of the D.C. sniper rampage 17 years ago, are supporting Malvo\u2019s bid to be resentenced for his life without parole term, which will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday as the latest chapter in the high court\u2019s evolving reconsideration of how to handle juveniles in the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cThis is not about him being released,\u201d Nichols said, knowing that even reducing Malvo\u2019s 10 life sentences would not lead to his freedom. \u201cThe first time I heard it, I was like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 This was someone sent to my door to kill me. But as I listened more and more, I understood the totality of what\u2019s involved, and the other families involved in youths sentenced to life without parole \u2026 I believe there\u2019s a bigger picture here. This is something that needs to be done.\"\n\nNot all victims want to see Malvo\u2019s case reopened. Nelson Rivera, whose wife Lori Lewis Rivera, 25, was killed by the snipers in Kensington, Md., joined an amicus brief filed by the Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center that said the rulings clearing the way for Malvo\u2019s resentencing \u201cre-traumatize, revictimize, and violate the legal and human rights of victims.\u201d The center\u2019s lawyer, Victor Stone, said that \u201cpeople like Mr. Rivera lost a really important family member.\u201d Ordering new hearings \u201cputs a tremendous burden and revictimization on victims\u2019 families who struggle with that loss. They spent years trying to resume a normal life. The lack of finality to them, that is really something,\u201d particularly if they must relive the trauma in new hearings.\n\n\n\nPaul LaRuffa, who was shot at close range by Lee Boyd Malvo in 2002, now supports Malvo's bid for resentencing after the Supreme Court ruled that juvenile defendants should not receive mandatory life sentences. (Marvin Joseph\/The Washington Post) (MARVIN JOSEPH\/TWP\/TWP)\n\nAfter Cook\u2019s slaying in Washington state, Malvo and Muhammad shot at least 21 more people around the country, killing 14 of them, including 10 homicides in the Washington area in a three-week rampage in October 2002. The shootings gripped the D.C. region and the world. The pair were arrested near Frederick, Md., and prosecuted in Virginia in 2003, where capital punishment was still an option for juveniles. Muhammad was sentenced to death, but Malvo\u2019s jury chose a life sentence without parole rather than death for the Jamaican teen, who was 17 at the time of the sniper shootings. He then entered pleas in two additional Virginia shootings, and in six Maryland slayings, and received eight more life sentences.\n\nThen the Supreme Court began a string of rulings that recognized the developing nature of teenage brains and changed the way juveniles are prosecuted. First in 2005, the court ruled that it was unconstitutional for juveniles to receive the death penalty, and in 2010 that juveniles may not receive life sentences for non-homicide convictions. Then in 2012, in Miller v. Alabama, the court ruled that juveniles may not be sentenced to life without parole unless they are found to be irreparably criminal. And in 2016, in Montgomery v. Louisiana, the court ruled that its Miller ruling could be applied to juvenile life sentences imposed years earlier.\n\n\u201cThe distinctive attributes of youth,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan wrote in Miller, \u201cdiminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes.\u201d The ruling did not prohibit life sentences without parole, but required that judges or juries consider whether the crime \u201creflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity,\u201d or the defendant is \u201cthe rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption\u201d deserving of the harshest penalty.\n\nAnd so Malvo, through his original trial attorney Craig S. Cooley, sought a new sentencing in Virginia. Malvo at the time was one of about 2,800 people nationwide who were juveniles when they were sentenced to life without parole, according to the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. Once the Supreme Court declared that the Miller ruling was retroactive, resentencing hearings began across the country, with about 1,950 inmates getting new hearings or relief from new laws: 22 states and the District of Columbia have now prohibited life sentences without parole for juveniles.\n\nThere is also a racial disparity to juvenile sentencings, said Jody Kent Lavy, executive director of the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. \u201cAfrican American youth get life sentences at a rate of 10 times white youth,\u201d Lavy said. \u201cAnd racial disparity actually increases when judges get more discretion in sentencing.\u201d\n\nMalvo, now 34, is one of 12 people sentenced as juveniles and serving life in Virginia, and \u201che understands that even if his sentence is reduced \u2026 he\u2019s not getting out,\u201d Cooley said. Malvo has six convictions in Maryland, where a similar motion for resentencing is pending, and prosecutors in Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Washington state could still charge him with murder. \u201cIt may benefit people who have only one charge and sentence to deal with,\" Cooley said of the Supreme Court case. \"It\u2019s an important case for precedential purposes.\u201d\n\nCooley and Malvo first had their resentencing motion granted in 2017 by U.S. District Judge Raymond A. Jackson, who made it clear that Malvo\u2019s two convictions in Fairfax County, Va. \u2014 capital murder of FBI analyst Linda Franklin as an act of terrorism, and multiple murders in a three-year period \u2014 and two in Spotsylvania County, Va., were undisturbed and that new sentences could still result in life without parole. In Virginia, juries determine sentences in criminal cases, and judges then impose those sentences, with the option only to reduce them.\n\nMalvo\u2019s trial in 2003 was essentially one long sentencing hearing, in which his defense team laid out his troubled life story, and manipulation by Muhammad, as part of an insanity defense, which the jury rejected. But neither the jury nor Fairfax Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush considered the criteria established nine years later by the Supreme Court of \u201cirreparable corruption\u201d and the \u201ctransient immaturity of youth,\u201d and Jackson ruled that Malvo was entitled to have his crimes reviewed through that lens.\n\nFranklin\u2019s husband, William \u201cTed\u201d Franklin, said he was unfamiliar with developments in the case and declined to comment.\n\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D) appealed Jackson\u2019s ruling, and last year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reluctantly sided with Malvo. Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Robert B. King and Albert Diaz wrote that their conclusions were made \u201cnot with any satisfaction but to sustain the law.\u201d\n\nHerring appealed again, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.\n\nThe attorney general argues that the lower courts improperly expanded the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings to cases where the court had discretion in sentencing, as opposed to a mandatory life sentence.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Fairfax County Chief Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh, left, and Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan enter the courthouse before the trial of Lee Boyd Malvo. (Rich Lipski\/The Washington Post)\n\nVirginia has argued twice (and lost twice) that the judge in Malvo\u2019s case had the discretion to reduce the jury\u2019s life term for capital murder to something less. In 2017, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that life sentences in capital murder cases could be partially suspended. Cooley said that in 2003 \u201ceverybody in the state who did these things believed there was no prerogative for the judge. Certainly the judge didn\u2019t think so.\u201d Cooley, who has tried dozens of capital murder cases and taught capital murder at the University of Richmond Law School, said, \u201cNever did anybody suggest there anything other than the two options: death or life without parole.\u201d\n\nRoush, who imposed the jury\u2019s two life sentences in March 2004, is now retired. She declined to comment. Malvo\u2019s Supreme Court brief notes that Virginia \u201chas identified no case prior to Miller, and counsel is aware of none, in which a Virginia court sentenced a juvenile convicted of capital murder to anything less than life without parole.\u201d For the Supreme Court case, Cooley recruited Washington lawyer Danielle Spinelli to lead Malvo\u2019s team. Spinelli was part of the team that persuaded the high court in 2005 to ban executions for juveniles.\n\n\n\nLee Boyd Malvo, now 34, in a recent photo from the Virginia Department of Corrections. He is serving life without parole at the Red Onion State Prison in Wise County, Va. (AP\/AP)\n\n\u201cA life-without-parole sentence\u201d for a juvenile without considering a defendant\u2019s maturity and changeability, Spinelli wrote, \u201cviolates Miller whether it is \u2018mandatory\u2019 or not.\u201d\n\nBut the 4th Circuit ruled that it didn\u2019t have to decide whether Malvo\u2019s sentences were mandatory because the Montgomery case confirmed that \u201ca sentencing judge also violates Miller\u2019s rule any time it imposes a discretionary life-without-parole sentence\u201d without first making a finding of permanent incorrigibility.\n\nFairfax County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh, who helped prosecute Malvo in 2003, said Virginia law has never prohibited judges from suspending part of a capital murder sentence, as it specifically does for other crimes.\n\nMorrogh noted that Malvo\u2019s maturity and culpability were amply explored at his trial. \u201cThat was the crux of the defense argument for a month in front of the jury,\u201d Morrogh said. \u201cIt is a rare case that any juvenile should get a life sentence, but these were multiple killings. In my opinion, he was at least as bad as Muhammad. He sat there during the trial and drew pictures of [former Fairfax prosecutor] Bob [Horan] and me with targets on our backs.\u201d\n\nThe case has attracted amicus briefs from significant parties on both sides. The Justice Department filed a brief in support of Virginia, and the court has granted the solicitor general time to participate in Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments.\n\nStone said the impact on the victims should not be overlooked. \u201cThis affects lots of lives across the country,\u201d Stone said. He has represented victims whose juvenile offenders won resentencings in Maryland, and \u201csome ask for our help, some can\u2019t talk when they stand up in court, and some don\u2019t want to deal with it. Their whole life was changed.\u201d\n\nThe American Bar Association and a group of former and current state and federal prosecutors and judges, to include former FBI and CIA director William Webster, filed briefs on behalf of Malvo, as did a group of crime victims including sniper victims Nichols, shooting survivor Paul LaRuffa and Cheryll Shaw, whose father Jerry Taylor was killed in Arizona in March 2002.\n\n\n\nCraig S.

Malvo then took $3,000 cash and LaRuffa\u2019s laptop, which Muhammad used to plot subsequent violence. LaRuffa recovered, is now retired, and supports Malvo\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cI really agree there is a big difference between youth and adult offenders,\u201d LaRuffa said, \u201cand I think they should be treated differently in the justice system. They have a better chance of being rehabilitated.\u201d He said it was \u201chard when you use Malvo as an example,\u201d because the sniper shootings were so horrific. \u201cThis case is for all juveniles. I think it\u2019s reasonable to say if the death penalty for young people is off the table, it\u2019s kind of the same reason life without parole is off the table.\u201d","44":"\u201cPhillips may want us to think he\u2019s giving us a movie all about the emptiness of our culture \u2014 but really, he\u2019s offering a prime example of it,\u201d Zacharek wrote.

But I was not afraid.\u201d\n\nChujfi and his wife Juliana Gonz\u00e1lez both grew up in Pereira, a mountainous coffee region in Colombia (although they actually met later, after they\u2019d both left). He moved to Germany for a job as a systems engineer; back in Colombia, Gonz\u00e1lez worked in strategic communications with a background in international affairs.\n\nOf course, following her heart, Gonz\u00e1lez joined Chujfi in 2002. They both fell in love with the richness of Berlin\u2019s history and the city\u2019s potential. It wasn\u2019t an easy path\u2014Colombia is thousands of miles from Germany, in all kinds of ways\u2014but they were determined.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going to learn German, I don\u2019t care how long it\u2019s going to take,\u2019\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez recalls. \u201cIt was just trying to realize, \u2018who am I in this new place,\u2019 and defining myself, that took more time. The first years were very confusing for me, but language was my vehicle to move forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Chujfi echoes. \u201cThat\u2019s the best decision anyone can make.\u201d\n\nChujfi eventually launched his own innovative telecommunications company, Sabienzia; he strongly believes \u201ctrustable technology is made in Germany\u201d. Gonz\u00e1lez found a job as a producer in the Spanish department of broadcaster Deutsche Welle and later worked as the deputy chief of mission at the Colombian embassy. Their two daughters, Hanna and Claire, were born in Berlin and now ping-pong fluently between Spanish, German, and English.\n\nBut two years ago, the family faced a tough decision of whether to return to Colombia. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s embassy work was putting her in very close contact with the politics and affairs in her home country, and her passion about these matters made her wonder whether it would be better to simply go back.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in the middle of a bridge, and I wondered whether I should cross that bridge or take a step back and remain here,\u201d she says.\n\nBut Chujfi had a successful business to run, and Gonz\u00e1lez was welcomed back to Deutsche Welle, where she is now a political correspondent.\n\nUltimately, it was their lifestyle that kept them in Berlin.\n\n\u201cI can ride my bike to the office, I can drop the kids off at school. You work, but you also have a fulfilled life,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cIt gives me a sense of freedom, of security.

She had been camping with a friend in Paris and applying to a slew of startup jobs in Berlin with no luck. And then, on the day her train was leaving for Berlin, she received an email about a Skype interview for a marketing position in a housing rental startup. She was hired on the spot.\n\nThe ex-Parisian arrived in the city in the winter of 2014 after deciding to quit the French capital. A six-month Erasmus exchange program in Oslo where she reveled in an international cohort had opened her eyes to the world, and she couldn\u2019t face working in Paris after going back to complete her studies there.\n\n\u201cI started feeling repressed there,\u201d Roux recalls. She had studied political science and communications at the Paris-Sorbonne University and interned at the European Parliament in France.\n\n\u201cBut I started to have this other image for myself, of someone doing something completely different than working for a political party or for French institutions. I came to Berlin really without a plan\u2014it was a complete coup de t\u00eate.\u201d\n\nIn Berlin she did a Weiterbildung\u2014German for \u201ctraineeship\u201d\u2014in website conception and online communication, and decided to forge her own way as freelancer. She now builds online communication strategies for small companies in Berlin and France.\n\nA typical weekday for Roux starts with breakfast with her boyfriend\u2014a German artist\u2014and listening to her favorite French radio show. \u201cI know I should listen to German programs, but I can\u2019t help myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t skip my mother tongue in the mornings.\u201d\n\nThen she works from home in Friedrichshain, a young, bustling neighborhood on Berlin\u2019s eastern flank, before heading out for a few client meetings in the afternoon. The evenings are devoted to German class or an art exhibition and dinner in one of the neighborhood\u2019s many restaurants.\n\nWeekends have gotten a lot more wholesome. Roux used to explore Berlin\u2019s club scene, but these days\u2014particularly during the summer\u2014her favorite thing to do is take her bike to one of the city\u2019s myriad lakes and picnic all afternoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really a lake freak,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful to have so many lakes around Berlin. I feel so much more connected to nature here than I ever was in Paris.\u201d\n\nOf course, she misses home, but she\u2019s convinced she\u2019s found her personal island in the German capital.\n\n\u201cI also could have a very beautiful life in France,\u201d she says. \u201cBut in Paris, it\u2019s just much more coded; if you want to get your baguette, you can\u2019t go in your pajamas.

And it\u2019s this personal mandate that pulled him to Berlin.\n\nAfter finishing his doctorate in musical arts in 2016 at the California Institute of the Arts, where he was also a lecturer, Lima moved back to his parents\u2019 house in his native Brazil. By 2019 his compositional repertoire already included pieces for dance, theater, cinema installations and orchestra, but he found teaching was the only sustainable way to make a living.\n\nEventually two things became clear: he had to leave the academic world, and he had to leave Brazil.\n\n\u201cI always felt really trapped inside the university,\u201d Lima says. \u201cIn Brazil, academia is very much based on a conservative French model. And you have a strong divide: either you have an academic career, or you have an artistic career, which is a whole other world.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the political climate back home was deteriorating; Jair Bolsonaro was rising to power, and once in office, he began cutting budgets from the country\u2019s top universities. Lima was pessimistic. He had three concerts in Europe, and he took the chance to visit Berlin and see if it was a place where he could find a haven.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have a situation like this, you have resistance\u2014there\u2019s more engagement from people from the left, from artists and intellectuals, and that can be empowering,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019d already felt displaced. I studied abroad and had been gone for so long.\u201d\n\nMoving to Berlin offered Lima a kind of personal liberation. It\u2019s a theme that resonates deeply within his work, which engages heavily with the notions of failure and vulnerability. And the experimental music scene here was exactly what he was searching for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect setting to experiment [with] this liberation I\u2019m in need of to be reborn artistically,\u201d Lima says. \u201cBeing a classical pianist is a very Olympic career. You\u2019re always dealing with a very high standard. I don\u2019t even have a piano here.\u201d\n\nLima is still getting settled.

(Andres Leiva\/Palm Beach Post\/Associated Press)\n\nPolice have yet to find evidence of gunfire after a report of an active shooter that sent a Florida mall into lockdown on Sunday, in the latest incident of panic after deadly attacks nationwide.\n\nA man taken to the hospital with a \u201ctraumatic injury\u201d was not shot, as police had said earlier, but instead hit his head as he tried to escape Town Center at Boca Raton, Police Chief Dan Alexander told reporters. Surveillance video shows people in the mall\u2019s food court turning in what appears to be a reaction to a loud noise, he added.\n\n\u201cThere was something that happened inside that mall today that caused people to get concerned \u2014 a lot of people at one time,\u201d he said, calling the day\u2019s alarm an indication of \u201cthe unfortunate state that we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nLocal and federal authorities are trying to pin down the details of what police are now calling a \u201csuspicious incident.\u201d No shell casings or signs of a weapon have been found, police said.\n\nWith few details about the incident available Sunday afternoon, people took to social media to share what they had seen and heard. Shaky videos captured shoppers rushing to get outside while others sheltered in stores, urged by officials to wait for help while SWAT teams searched the area.\n\nThe chaotic scene quickly drew comparisons to the Aug. 3 shooting at a shopping area in El Paso that left 22 dead. That massacre and so many others have put shoppers on high alert as loud noises and armed confrontations cause panic and as fears rise that crowded public places present \u201csoft targets\u201d for acts of violence.\n\nIn Boca Raton, police tweeted at 3:30 p.m. Sunday that authorities were on the scene. By 4:15 p.m., they said there was \u201cno active shooter at this time,\u201d although authorities continued to search the mall.\n\nI am currently stuck in a Victoria Secret due to a reported shooter in the Boca Raton Town Center Mall, I am safe w my friends.

Others recalled what sounded \u201clike pops, not automatic gunfire,\u201d per a journalist\u2019s tweet. Employees caught in the mall\u2019s lockdown texted their loved ones, a local reporter said, while crowds filled the parking lot outside the upscale complex billed online as \u201cone of south Florida\u2019s top luxury shopping destinations.\u201d\n\nMany said they simply saw people running and joined them.\n\nOne student at Boca Raton High School, who declined to give her name, told the Palm Beach Post that she reacted based on her school\u2019s regular instructions for responding to a \u201ccode red.\"\n\n\u201cWe have this training. \u2026 I just ran,\u201d she said as her family remained stuck indoors.\n\nRalph Saintilien, a sales associate at the mall\u2019s Forever 21 store, told the newspaper that he stayed calm as he left the building, wary of increasing the risk of someone getting hurt. Police said some people suffered minor injuries while fleeing.\n\nThe man with the head injury was taken to Delray Medical Center, police said.\n\nOfficials said in the evening that most people had been able to leave the mall \u2014 and urged patience as some remained trapped.\n\n\u201cWe have been stuck inside a store since 3:15 today,\u201d one Twitter user wrote at about 6 p.m. \u201cWhat is the time frame to let us out!?!\u201d\n\nOne girl lost her shoe in the scuffle to get out.

In August, days after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, a backfiring motorcycle triggered a stampede in Times Square. So did the sounds of a falling sign in Utah.\n\nOther evacuations involve weapons brandished but not fired: In August, a Walmart in Missouri evacuated after a man showed up armed with a military-style rifle in what he called a \u201csocial experiment\u201d meant to test his Second Amendment rights. He was charged with making a terrorist threat. That same month, fearful customers ran out of another Walmart in Louisiana after men drew weapons during an argument, police said.\n\nWhatever the cause or ultimate damage, the terror of an active-shooter alert can traumatize people and take a toll on police resources, experts say. Police told The Washington Post earlier this year that they respond to each alarm ready for the next massacre.\n\n\u201cIf people are reporting a critical incident or being descriptive in terms of someone shooting, [saying] there\u2019s an active shooter \u2014 especially since we\u2019ve had something significant occur here in the past \u2014 we\u2019re responding as if it\u2019s real and preparing to deal with that particular threat,\u201d said David L.

(Ammar Awad\/Reuters)\n\nProtesters gathered in the tens of thousands in central Hong Kong on Monday night, pleading with American lawmakers for the second time to pass legislation that supports the territory\u2019s democratic aspirations and punishes those who try to curtail it.\n\nThe demonstration, the first approved by authorities since the imposition of an anti-mask ban at all public gatherings, was marked by the sense of anguish that has gripped the movement after months of protesting. Instead of offering any further concessions, the government has instead expanded police powers and imposed more restrictions.\n\nAs the crackdown on protests intensifies \u2014 with the arrest of more than 2,500, including 201 arrested in smaller-scale protests over the weekend \u2014 some see foreign pressure as the best hope for securing a democratic future for Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cOur citizens do not have any kind of power to fight against the government,\u201d said Crystal Yeung, 23, standing among thousands of protesters spilling out onto roads from a small square that couldn\u2019t contain the rally. \u201cWe are relying on the U.S. to punish to those who are trying to breach the Hong Kong law.\u201d\n\n[For many in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s troops are already here: The Hong Kong Police Force]\n\nProtesters are specifically hoping for the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan support. The bill, which will require the annual review of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong and allow sanctions on those found to be \u201csuppressing basic freedoms,\u201d was fast-tracked through the House and could be discussed as soon as this week. In the Senate, it remains in committee.\n\nA large demonstration was first held in September in support of the bill, but protest organizers want to keep the pressure on as it makes it way through the congressional process.\n\n\u201cThe bill is necessary in order to give pressure on Chinese and Hong Kong government,\u201d said Ventus Lau, one of the organizers of Monday\u2019s demonstration. \u201cWe have to do everything possible to push for a quick passing of the law.\u201d\n\nThe international push is among several strategies employed by protesters as the Hong Kong government digs in their heels in against any further concession to the movement. Protests began in June over a bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China, but have since swelled into a sustained effort at securing direct elections for Hong Kong and against increasingly harsh police tactics. Communities are divided, businesses are suffering and violence is increasing as the dissent drags on.\n\nSeveral Republican senators have recently visited Hong Kong, including Ted Cruz (R.-Tex) and Josh Hawley (R.-Mo) to observe the protests and speak to pro-democracy activists. Both are sponsors of the Human Rights and Democracy Act.\n\n\n\nRepublican Senator from Missouri Josh Hawley listens to questions from members of the media at a hotel in Hong Kong on Oct. 14, 2019. (Mohd Rasfan\/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nThe bill \u201chas come up in every single meeting\u201d with pro-democracy activists in the city, said Hawley, speaking in Hong Kong to a small group of reporters. He said the legislation could be voted on in the House as early as this week. \u201cIt is obviously a very felt and urgent concern here in the city, and rightly so.\u201d\n\nProminent activist Joshua Wong, speaking at the rally, noted that when the bill was first floated, only a handful backed it. Today, more than 60 lawmakers have supported the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe owe it all to the blood and sweat spared by the front-line protesters and the peaceful protesters,\u201d Wong said, before leading the group into a cheer of \u201cPass the act!\u201d Chants were so loud they could be heard miles from the rally\u2019s gathering point.\n\nYet, condemnation from American lawmakers and the pro-democracy movement\u2019s appeal to the Western world appears to be fueling Beijing\u2019s fears that Hong Kong\u2019s protests are the product of foreign meddling designed to weaken China. Speaking Sunday in Nepal, Chinese President Xi Jinping said any attempt \u201cto split China in any part of the country will end in \u201ccrushed bodies and shattered bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any external forces backing such attempts to divide China will be deemed by the Chinese people as pipe-dreaming!\u201d he added.\n\nMichael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who has supported pro-democracy positions like an independent inquiry into the police, says hawkish pro-establishment conservatives are feeding these theories of foreign interference to mainland Chinese authorities.\n\n\u201cBeijing is convinced,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are talking about Communist China. The one thing they hate is their own people going to a foreign government asking for help, and particularly this foreign government, who is trying to nail China.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has appeared to change his tone on Hong Kong several times in recent months. At the United Nations, he made strong comments in defense of the city\u2019s promised autonomy, saying the world \u201cfully expects\u201d Beijing will protect \u201cHong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week after a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, however, Trump said the situation in Hong Kong is \u201cgoing to take care of itself\u201d and has \u201cde-escalated\u201d.\n\nHawley, the congressman, said the situation in Hong Kong is an \u201curgent, pressing concern\u201d and would share his experiences with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, protests broke out in several areas of the city, a new tactic that sought to scatter the police force, allow demonstrators to stick to local neighborhoods they are most familiar with and avoid transit shutdowns. Numbers however were much smaller than in past rallies, and police were able to make a large number of arrests compared to the size of the demonstrating crowd.\n\n[From Shake Shack to Starbucks, the Hong Kong-China standoff is proving bad for business]\n\nProtester violence has also increased, leaving 12 officers wounded, including one who was cut in the back of his neck by a sharp object. What appeared to be a homemade bomb was set off near a police car, and a police station in Mongkok was hit by over a dozen petrol bombs.\n\nPolice said 201 protesters between the ages of 14 to 62 were arrested between Friday to Sunday.\n\n\n\nAnti-government demonstrator holds a placard as they march in protest against the invocation of the emergency laws in Hong Kong, China, Oct. 14, 2019.

If you still tolerate such acts, you are simply inciting them to escalate their violence.\u201d\n\nYeung, who was attending the rally with her boyfriend, added that even without any American action on the bill, Hong Kong\u2019s fight will go on.

Our bodies produce a fresh liter of slime each day to coat our passages and tracts. Mucus may be gross, but its grossness disguises how helpful it is.\n\nA study published Monday in Nature Microbiology demonstrates one of mucus\u2019 unexpected beneficial properties: Mucus contains sugars that keep potentially harmful germs in check.\n\nBiophysicist Katharina Ribbeck at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has spent more than a decade exploring the biochemistry that happens within mucus. \u201cMucus piqued my interest because it is just this vastly understudied material that occupies a large surface area in our body,\u201d Ribbeck said. The gel lubricates the esophagus, lines the stomach, helps sperm move past the cervix, and guards nasal tissues.\n\nRibbeck and her colleagues study compounds called mucins in mucus. Mucins are long polymers, or molecular chains, densely studded with sugars. They \u201clook like mini bottlebrushes,\u201d Ribbeck said, except bristling with sugar molecules where whiskers would be.\n\n\u201cMucus has for too long been considered bad in general public, but also in medicine,\u201d said Gunnar C. Hansson, who studies mucin compounds at the Unversity of Gothenburg in Sweden and was not a member of the team behind the new work. \u201cMucus and mucins are extremely complex to study and has been lagging almost all other types of biomedical research.\u201d\n\nThe textbook model of mucus \u2014 a filter that traps and eliminates microbes \u2014 isn\u2019t entirely accurate. \u201cWe added microbes into mucus and we saw they don\u2019t get trapped at all,\u201d Ribbeck said. Inside a glob of mucus, bacteria swim freely, in a state the scientist describes as \u201cplanktonic.\u201d That helps our immune systems. A lone drifter, as opposed to many germs gathered in tough-to-penetrate clumps, makes an easier target for immune cells.\n\nBut not all bacteria need to be killed. Only a minority, in fact, are harmful. \u201cWe have trillions of microbes growing outside and inside of our body,\u201d Ribbeck said. Microorganisms that live in the mucus of the digestive tract, for instance, help process food. \u201cWe provide the microbes the home, and in return, they do a service,\u201d Ribbeck said. Mucus, she suspected, might be part of the process that domesticates germs into friendlier inhabitants.\n\nKelsey Wheeler, a doctoral student in Ribbeck\u2019s lab and a co-author of the paper, said that previous research showed purified mucins prevented several types of potentially harmful microbes from clumping up. The new study is the first, she said, to \u201cidentify that the glycan component\u201d \u2014 meaning, the sugars grafted to the mucins \u2014 \u201cis responsible for suppressing antagonistic microbial behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe scientists used several experiments to test the power of mucus. They embedded microbes in globs of mucus, what Ribbeck called \u201ca three-dimensional mucus matrix.\" They cultured germs alongside human epithelial cells and mucus sugars. And they used the sugars to heal infected burn wounds in pigs. (To gather enough mucus to study, researchers collected donations of human saliva and scraped out pig guts.)\n\nWheeler, Ribbeck and their colleagues tested how the sugars interacted with a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The microbe does not normally cause disease, except when it infects people with cystic fibrosis or compromised immune systems.\n\nThe scientists wanted to know whether sugars worked by themselves, so they shook the glycans free from the polymer. (Imagine snipping the whiskers off a bottlebrush.) Pseudomonas reacted to the sugars by becoming less infectious. The mucus compounds suppressed various genetic pathways in the bacteria including factors related to killing other microbes, toxin secretion, cell-cell communication and clump formation.\n\nMucus sugars are \u201clike pixie dust,\u201d Ribbeck said. \"Oh my goodness, they\u2019re so active.\u201d\n\nPediatrics professor Lars Bode, who studies sugars in breast milk at the University of California at San Diego and was not involved with this research, was intrigued by these abilities. Breast milk contains many small sugar molecules with similar structures, which Bode hypothesized may have similar effects when they are passed from mother to infant.\n\n\u201cInstead of using antibiotics when these things turn against us, why don\u2019t we prevent them from turning against us in the first place?\u201d Bode said.\n\nResearch not yet published suggests that the sugars can tame other types of microorganisms, including yeast and the bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Ribbeck said. The scientist was excited by the therapeutic potential of these molecules, she said, as more bacteria become resistant to drugs meant to kill them.\n\n\u201cChanging their ability to cause infections could be a really potent strategy,\u201d Ribbeck said. Call it the taming of the goo.\n\nRead more:\n\nImmigrants arrive with flourishing gut microbes.

(Yonhap\/EPA-EFE\/Shutterstock)\n\nLeading South Korean K-pop singer and actress Sulli was found dead in her house south of the capital on Monday in what police said may have been suicide.\n\nThe 25-year-old started her career as a child actress in 2005 and later joined a girl group as a teenager, before announcing she was quitting the entertainment industry in 2014. She said then that she was mentally and physically exhausted after suffering from malicious comments and false rumors online. She formally left her band the following year to resume an acting career.\n\nLast year, she took the rare step of speaking out about her mental health issues, saying she had suffered from panic disorder since she was young and also had social phobia.\n\nIf she is found to have taken her own life, it would highlight the huge pressures on K-pop stars exerted by exploitative management companies and demanding fans and the lack of mental health support.\n\nThe star, whose legal name is Choi Jin-ri, was found dead by her agent on Monday afternoon in a two-story house in Seongnam.\n\nA note believed to have been written by Choi has been found at the house, which described her state of mind but was not a suicide note, according to the police.\n\n\u201cChoi seemed to have lived alone in the house, and no signs of a struggle or forced entry has been identified to suggest homicide,\u201d said Kim Seong-taek of Seongnam Sujeong Police Department. But Kim said police had not concluded it was definitely a suicide and continued to investigate the case.\n\nSulli challenged the notions on how a female Kpop star should behave, but she suffered massively as a result.\n\nShe was viciously attacked online in 2014 after paparazzi photos revealed she was dating an older rapper. In a rare move, she later publicly acknowledged the couple\u2019s relationship. K-pop stars usually face pressure not to date because it can disillusion their fans and undermine their career.\n\nShe would also often appear without a bra, saying she felt more comfortable without one, something that some Korean women found liberating but others savagely criticized.\n\nIn June, she became a co-host of a TV show entitled \u201cThe Night of Hate Comments,\u201d in which celebrity guests discussed their reactions to hateful comments, malicious rumors and cyberbullying.\n\nYonhap news agency said Choi had suffered criticism and drawn support for what it called her \u201cbold and carefree character.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven close people left me,\u201d Choi said in an Instagram video posted last year. \u201cI was hurt by them and felt there was nobody who understands me, which made me fall apart.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nSex scandals stain the clean-cut image of South Korea\u2019s K-pop\n\nHow K-pop is luring young North Koreans to cross the line\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","50":"It wasn\u2019t just two exceptional teams and two successful organizations battling each other across Minute Maid Park\u2019s diamond Sunday night in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series \u2014 a classic, taut contest that stretched on for nearly five hours \u2014 it was also two philosophies and two divergent blueprints for achieving the same essential goal: securing the 27 outs necessary to win a baseball game.\n\nThe New York Yankees, a team built on relief pitching, went to their bullpen early and often. The Houston Astros, with one of the best rotations in the game, rode their future Hall of Fame starting pitcher as deep into the game as they could, then pieced it together from there. Each strategy had its own logic but also its own inherent dangers, especially as the game careened into extra innings.\n\nIn the end, the Astros\u2019 3-2 win wasn\u2019t so much the validation of a philosophy as the result of one night\u2019s worth of exceptional performance sprinkled with bits of good fortune \u2014 but above all, it was a massive victory for the Astros themselves, who evened the best-of-seven series at one game apiece. And it didn\u2019t take 27 outs; it took 33.\n\nAstros shortstop Carlos Correa ended it with a majestic, no-doubt, opposite-field home run on the first pitch of the bottom of the 11th inning from Yankees lefty J.A. Happ, New York\u2019s ninth pitcher of the night. Correa barely budged from the batter\u2019s box at first, then casually tossed his bat, cupped his hand to the ear-hole of his helmet and strutted up the first base line, while his teammates spilled out of their dugout and a crowd of 43,359 went wild.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I hit it, I knew it was going over the fence,\u201d Correa said. \u201cThe adrenaline started pumping like crazy. I don\u2019t even know what I did. \u2026 Obviously, it\u2019s a moment that\u2019s going to live with me forever.\u201d\n\n[Astros\u2019 dugout paramedic in stable condition after being struck by foul ball during ALCS Game 2]\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s travel day, the series resumes with Game 3 at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday, with Houston ace Gerrit Cole facing Yankees right-hander Luis Severino.\n\n\u201cBefore the game, we were saying, \u2018We have to win this game. We have to go to New York, 1-1,\u2019 \u201d said Robinson Chirinos, who caught all 11 innings and 175 pitches for the Astros. \u201cEverybody was talking about that. Thank God we split the series here at home, so we\u2019re going to go to New York and take care of business there.\u201d\n\nSunday night\u2019s game was an exquisite pitchers\u2019 duel \u2014 with offense scarce and the tension rising \u2014 just not in the traditional sense.\n\nAstros starter Justin Verlander, a longtime Yankees postseason nemesis, limited them to two runs over his 6\u2154 innings and 109 pitches, with both runs coming on Aaron Judge\u2019s homer to center in the fourth. But the Yankees, more or less by design, got only seven outs from starter James Paxton, then cycled through their five best relievers to carry the game to extra innings. Navigating the 10th required the services of converted starters CC Sabathia and Happ.\n\n\u201cI just felt like we were covered, as far as getting some length and having guys rested,\u201d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cObviously, going into an off-day [Monday], we\u2019re going to be aggressive. \u2026 Bottom line is, we end up giving up a third run in the 11th inning. I\u2019d say from a run-prevention standpoint, we did pretty well.\u201d\n\nIn a seven-game series, it is remarkable how quickly fortunes can turn. After Saturday night\u2019s win in Game 1, the Yankees gained home-field advantage and an immeasurable psychic benefit of beating the Astros in their home park. But suddenly, after Sunday night, it is the Yankees facing an unpleasant scenario, with Cole, the most unbeatable pitcher in the game at the moment, waiting for them in Game 3 and yet another injury crisis to face.\n\nLeft fielder Giancarlo Stanton, one of a record-setting 30 Yankees players who spent time on the injured list this season, suffered a strained quadriceps muscle in Saturday night\u2019s Game 1 and was left out of their lineup Sunday. His status is considered day to day, and any thought the Yankees might have of replacing him on their roster is tempered by the knowledge that doing so would also make Stanton ineligible for the World Series, should the Yankees advance.\n\n[These are the Astros and Yankees who will decide the ALCS]\n\nFew games in recent memory had witnessed so many rockets and lasers landing in gloves. The Astros alone hit at least six line drives directly at Yankees fielders for outs \u2014 in some cases into the teeth of a well-designed shift. Both teams hit deep flyballs that appeared headed for the seats, only to die at the warning track \u2014 part of a sustained pattern across the sport this month that has some questioning the properties of the postseason baseballs.\n\n\u201cEvery championship run, when you look back,\u201d Verlander said, \u201cthere\u2019s always moments throughout the course of a ballgame or a series [where it\u2019s], \u2018How did we win that game? What happened?\u2019 And I think tonight was nothing short of that.\u201d\n\nA 2-2 tie in the middle innings remained so through the top of the sixth only because of Correa\u2019s heads-up presence and elite arm. With runners on first and second and two outs, Brett Gardner hit a smash that one-hopped Astros second baseman Jose Altuve and caromed into shallow right-center field. As Yankees first baseman D.J. LeMahieu rounded third and headed home, waved in by third base coach Phil Nevin, Correa sprinted over, gathered it in and, from the outfield grass, fired a strike home to nail LeMahieu easily and end the inning.\n\n\u201cHe talked to me before the game and said, \u2018Jose, I\u2019m going to do something big tonight,\u2019 \u201d Altuve said of his double-play mate, Correa. \u201cHe really did. When he made that play, I thought, \u2018Okay.\u2019 Then he goes [to the plate] and hits a homer \u2014 I love it.\u201d\n\nVerlander pumped his fists coming off the mound, and Correa wagged his index finger \u2014 no, no, no \u2014 at no one in particular. But Verlander\u2019s night ended three batters into the seventh. The Astros don\u2019t have the same bullpen depth as the Yankees, but high-leverage slayer Will Harris got two critical outs, and closer Roberto Osuna, brought into a tie game in the eighth, collected five.\n\n\u201cAs you start to get to the end of it, we\u2019re both counting the number of pitchers we have left and we\u2019re going to maximize those guys,\u201d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cYou try not to run out of players. You try not to run out of pitching. But most importantly, you just try to win the game. \u2026 This was an epic game in the playoffs with everything on the line. So obviously this has only just begun. I\u2019m not drawing any conclusions. We\u2019re doing the best to put our players in the best position possible.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees, meanwhile, pulled starter Paxton after only 2\u2153 innings, at which point he had allowed only one run and four hits, and in a one-run game they launched the nightly parade of relievers for which they have become known. This postseason, they have yet to push a starter beyond 86 pitches, and only veteran right-hander Masahiro Tanaka, in Game 1, has secured an out beyond the fifth inning.\n\n\u201cI was expecting him a little bit longer,\u201d Altuve said of Paxton, \u201cbut I was happy when they took him out of the game. He was throwing 98 with nasty curve balls and cutters.\u201d\n\n[The Astros have one weakness. The Yankees are built to exploit it.]\n\nFirst up Sunday night was right-hander Chad Green, who retired all six batters he faced, throwing just 26 pitches \u2014 19 below his season high \u2014 and he looked like he had more left when Boone pulled him, one batter into the fifth, in favor of Adam Ottavino. In doing so, Boone may have been guilty of thinking ahead to Game 3 and\/or 4, hoping to conserve Green for later duty, rather than prioritizing winning the game in front of him.\n\nBut the inherent risk in \u201cbullpenning\u201d is that one weak link in the chain causes the whole thing to break down. With a one-run lead, the margin for error was tiny, and with Ottavino on the mound, the lead didn\u2019t even last for one pitch. The right-hander served up a hanging slider that George Springer crushed over the Crawford Boxes in left, tying the score at 2.\n\nOttavino gave way to right-hander Tommy Kahnle for seven outs, then Kahnle to lefty Zack Britton for three. Closer Aroldis Chapman worked a scoreless ninth. That was all more or less by design.\n\nBut then came the 10th, and then the 11th \u2013 the highly populated Yankees bullpen dwindling down to a lonely few. And then Correa\u2019s homer was sailing into the seats, and the Yankees were staggering off the field, all that work and all that planning undone \u2014 because baseball doesn\u2019t follow anybody\u2019s blueprint.","51":"There has been a steady drumbeat of attention for the sandbox builder. Mojang, the company behind the game, released two major updates in the past year or so. It\u2019s also working on two new offshoots of the original game. One is an augmented-reality experience for your phone (think Pok\u00e9mon Go) and the other, Minecraft Dungeon, is an RPG similar to Diablo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSwedish YouTube creator PewDiePie returned to Minecraft in June, bringing with him one of the largest audiences on the platform. He has already posted more than 100 Minecraft-themed videos. Some of the biggest Fortnite streamers are even swinging their pickax. Depending on how you play, some streamers have said Minecraft can be a welcome respite from the grinding gameplay of battles royal.\n\n\u201cEveryone has kind of been starved when it comes to creativity, and Minecraft allows them to sort of express that,\u201d professional Fortnite streamer Ali \u201cMyth\u201d Kabbani recently told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice break from the usual.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to return to mining or maybe create a new world for the first time, The Post talked with two YouTube creators \u2014 Preston Arsement of PrestonPlayz and Tyler Pappas of logdotzip \u2014 and asked for their advice.\n\nPick an edition: Bedrock or Java\n\nFirst, there are two slightly different versions of the main game \u2014 Bedrock and Java.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJava is the original version. It remains a hub for hobbyists who want to modify the game in their own custom servers. Minecraft, at its core, is an incredibly flexible game. People have created servers to play versions of Pok\u00e9mon. There are countless libraries online for Minecraft enthusiasts to play and alter older versions of the game.\n\nBedrock is the multiplatform edition of Minecraft, which allows players to mine with friends on other devices \u2014 phones, consoles, etc. In Bedrock, rather than adding lines of code to modify the game, there\u2019s a setup marketplace for the community.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace is basically this thriving ecosystem that takes the best of user-generated content and lets the player base purchase it,\u201d Pappa said. \u201cNot only to expand their gameplay experiences but to directly support the teams behind it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBedrock is a bit more buttoned-up and probably the future of the franchise with its cross-platform capabilities, while Java is the tried-and-true edition for some hardcore fans.\n\nIn the beginning, find your village people\n\nIf you\u2019re starting a new survival world in Minecraft, Pappa\u2019s recommendation is to get to the nearest village. These towns, and the villagers in them, are more important than ever after recent updates to the game.\n\nVillages will provide a roof over your head and an empty bed for those dark early days playing Minecraft. You can live off their crops and use the towns as a home base, at least until you build a house of your own.\n\nOnce you\u2019re on your own two feet, Pappa said you should make use of the utility blocks around town \u2014 even \u201cborrow\u201d a few to place in your future home. Grindstones, smokers, stone cutters and other utility blocks are all available for players to forge new items or craft more efficiently.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne update from Mojang has expanded on how and what you can trade with villagers. If you make the most of it, trading can become a simple way to get your hands on rare items, Pappa said. Protect the villagers from the aptly named \u201cpillagers,\u201d a new spawn in the game that will attack in coordinated raids, and you\u2019ll get better deals in trades with the townspeople.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making it more interactive and having more of an experience past beating the Ender Dragon,\u201d Arsement said.\n\nGo for a swim, play with animals\n\nYou could always swim in Minecraft, but a year ago Mojang provided a reason to explore the ocean depths with an Aquatic update. There are sunken ships, treasure maps, tridents and, yes, underwater zombies. You can build your next humble abode underwater, Pappas said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd what an exciting concept, right?\u201d he added. \u201cBuild underwater, give it an air dome. Watch as fish swim by your head.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile you\u2019re down there, swim with the dolphins or the puffer fish. Speaking of both, Minecraft now has more than your typical farm animals in the game \u2014 with bees, pandas, turtles and foxes that huddle into their own tail for a quick nap.\n\n\u201cMinecraft is a very relaxing game,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s got lovely piano music in the background. Fun cute animals to look at. There\u2019s no impetus to kill everyone and get first place, and I think that resonates with a lot of people,\u201d Pappas said, referring to Fortnite and other battle royal games.\n\nAD\n\nBut, despite all the new bells and whistles, the core game hasn\u2019t changed. Minecraft remains a massive sandbox to jump into whether you\u2019re looking to explore \u201can endless procedurally generated world\u201d or just create with a digital Lego set, Pappas said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a platform in which we can do whatever we want,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cThat\u2019s what has allowed it to survive for the last decade.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD","52":"Here\u2019s their advice to upgrade your game:\n\n1. Be quiet and listen\n\nRegistering and understanding noise is a huge key to helping you win. If you listen closely enough, you can predict what the enemy will do. Likewise, manage your own noise so you don\u2019t make your movements so obvious.\n\nAD\n\nUbisoft developed its own sound propagation system to make the game as realistic as possible. In typical games, you\u2019ll hear a noise from an adjacent room, but it\u2019s muffled. In Siege, noise travels from person to person through space in the shortest way possible, bouncing off walls and entering through doorways.\n\nAD\n\nNiclas \u201cPengu\u201d Mouritzen, flex player for the G2 Esports Siege team, said managing noise is something he and his teammates constantly work on. For example, jumping with your drone is quite loud, making it easy for enemies to track it down and destroy it. Mouritzen cautioned to only jump away if your drone is in danger of being destroyed.\n\nOne tip people don\u2019t think about, Mouritzen said, is that shooting out windows allows you to hear inside. Sound won\u2019t filter through the room unless the window is destroyed. It\u2019s the small things that are make or break in a realistic game like Siege.\n\nAD\n\n2. Learn the maps until you can see them blindfolded\n\nRainbow Six Siege features highly dynamic, destructible, multilevel maps. You can get shot from just about anywhere, which can make it frustrating to play for beginners.\n\nAD\n\nGabriel \u201cLaXInG\u201d Mirelez from Team Reciprocity, who has played competitively for 3\u00bd years, said he had the same issues as many other players in the beginning.\n\nThe classic Siege line of \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could die from there\u201d was a regular occurrence for Mirelez. But the difference between him and many others, he said, was the drive to improve.\n\n\u201cIf you want to improve, you really have to want it,\u201d Mirelez said. Doing the same thing over and over again isn\u2019t going to cut it in a game like Siege.\n\nAD\n\nHe recommends watching professional gameplay and high-level streamers to understand the best angles to take in a map. Keep yourself protected as much as possible while giving yourself the best angle to scope your enemies.\n\n3. Equip the right scope and attachments to fit the occasion\n\nPart of finding success in Siege is knowing which operator fits your situation and play style. More than that, you\u2019ll need to figure out which scopes to use when you are defending or attacking.\n\nAD\n\nThe game narrows down the scopes you can use in particular situations. Attackers and only a few defenders have the option of using ACOG, a scope with 2x magnification, but selecting it all the time isn\u2019t the best option. It forces you to hold and angle and rely on the enemy to make a mistake.\n\nAD\n\nBut in close-quarters combat, Mouritzen said, 1x sights, such as reflex and red dot, are king. They let you take things into your own hands and improve upon fragging (kills). However, if you are playing a support operator such as Thermite, it\u2019s best to hang back and hold down an angle with an ACOG sight.\n\n4. Use the right virtual and physical equipment\n\nIt\u2019s important that you nail down mechanics. In Siege, you\u2019ll need to be able to do a 180 on a dime and shoot first.\n\nYour mouse is the key to it all. It\u2019s important to find a mouse that fits your hand comfortably. That won\u2019t necessarily be the one that the pros are using, Mouritzen said. Sometimes they\u2019re using a mouse that\u2019s part of a sponsorship deal, so it may not work for you.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo calibrate your 180 game, align your mouse at the center of the mouse pad, turn 180 degrees to the left and return back to the center in one quick motion. If you can do that, you should have a good setup, Mouritzen said.\n\nIn addition to your own hardware, there\u2019s the virtual equipment to which each operator character has access. Blitz uses a riot shield that acts as a flashbang, Echo has a quadcopter drone that can disorient people, and Kaid electrifies shields, hatches and barbed wire with his Electroclaw. Understanding how this equipment synergizes with the rest of your team will help you to victory.\n\n5. Stack the odds\n\nTop of mind for the pros is kills, objective, survival rate and trade \u2014 also known as KOST. Some of the terms are obvious, like kills refers to eliminating opponents and the objective is how you approach planting\/disarming the bomb or holding an area. Survival rate is about improving your odds at living through an engagement, while trades refer to making opponents pay if they take out one of your teammates. Each of those concepts factors into a player\u2019s decision-making. What this really boils down to, Mouritzen said, is doing whatever it takes to give your team an advantage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf someone kills a teammate, are you able to at least trade the kill? Can you bring in another person to help clear a room? How can you leverage a numbers advantage? It all has to do with odds.\n\nTaking a 50-50 gunfight might work, but it can just as well cost you the game if you lose. That\u2019s probably not a worthwhile fight to pick. Efficient allocation of resources (teammates, drones, grenades, equipment, etc.) given the situation can change the odds to 80-20, the pros say, and help you confidently take a fight.\n\n\u201cClutching is great, but odds are much higher if you match the manpower,\u201d Mourtizen said.\n\nIt\u2019s a team game, after all.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD","53":"\n\nA Panera Bread store. (Rafael Crisostomo\/For The Washington Post)\n\nA man laughs hysterically in the short video that\u2019s racked up nearly 1 million likes, as the plastic packet of frozen mac and cheese is dropped into a boiler, cut open and then poured into a bowl ready to serve. The woman who posted the clip gives a thumbs-up in the hat that marks her as an employee of Panera Bread.\n\nThe caption on video-sharing app TikTok: \u201cexposing panera.\u201d\n\nThe clip brought a wave of gripes last week from disillusioned customers of a chain known for \u201cfast casual\u201d dining typically perceived as a step above fast food in quality. Commenters said they expected more than warmed-from-frozen dishes, or \u2014 as one critic put it \u2014 \u201cglorified hospital food.\u201d\n\nBut the fallout went both ways, the woman behind the video said, announcing Friday via her newly famous Twitter account: \u201clol i lost my job for this.\u201d\n\nApparently, this is how Panera Bread prepares the mac and cheese. (via TikTok) pic.twitter.com\/jUv47TYBhm \u2014 UberFacts (@UberFacts) October 11, 2019\n\nPanera Bread spokeswoman Jessica Hesselschwerdt declined to discuss personnel matters but told The Washington Post that the company has confirmed the TikTok video\u2019s authenticity. In a statement, the company defended its preparation methods, explaining its mac and cheese is still a patently Panera product \u201cmade offsite with our proprietary recipe developed by our chefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is shipped frozen to our bakery cafes \u2014 this allows us to avoid using preservatives which do not meet our clean standards,\u201d the company said.\n\nMany restaurants are reluctant to admit to heating up frozen food. After a survey of French restaurants found one-third acknowledged serving frozen items, some in the industry said the true number was probably higher because \u201cchefs were embarrassed to admit the short cuts that, in effect, hoodwink their customers,\u201d as The Post reported.\n\nPanera often joins popular chains such as Chipotle and Shake Shack under the label \u201cfast casual.\u201d Fast casual eateries \u201coffer consumers freshly-prepared, higher-quality food in an informal setting, with counter service to keep things speedy,\u201d the website Investopedia explains.\n\n\u201cThe two stalwarts of the American restaurant industry were always fast-food and fine dining, but now the rapidly growing fast-casual restaurant sector has squeezed in between them,\u201d the site adds, though it notes the industry is still dwarfed by traditional fast-food companies such as McDonald\u2019s.\n\nFor some critics, the TikTok video\u2019s depiction of mac-and-cheese preparation was at odds with Panera\u2019s image. Others were less surprised, though, chiming in with their stories of food prep from other chains. Some felt vindicated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before that Panera bread Mac and cheese is garbage, and here is the proof,\u201d a Twitter user posted.\n\nThen there were the people who declared they love Panera mac and cheese anyway \u2014 and wondered what all the fuss was about.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how almost all chain restaurants cook and serve their food,\u201d one person commented. \u201cIt\u2019s called efficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cOMG PANERA BREAD MAC AND CHEESE IS FROZEN??? I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!\u201d another joked, suggesting people were foolish to ever think the meal, listed online at $6.99 for a large bowl, was concocted on-site from scratch.\n\nThe item may be frozen, but it\u2019s also popular. Panera serves more than 3 million mac-and-cheese servings each month, according to the company.\n\nThe identity of the woman who posted the video is unclear, and she did not respond to an inquiry from The Post.\n\nHer latest tweets suggest a silver lining in the alleged firing, which has brought even more publicity: \u201csince it\u2019s blowing up again go follow my socials,\u201d she said Saturday.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow four dishes with roots in other lands tell a story of immigration\n\nWho says you can\u2019t eat red meat?

(Alexey Nikolsky\/Sputnik\/Kremlin\/Pool\/EPA-EFE\/REX\/Shutterstock)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin landed in Riyadh on Monday for his first state visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in more than a decade, emphasizing not only coordination between three of the biggest oil producers in the world but also Moscow\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East.\n\nThe timing may be especially fortuitous for Putin. President Trump\u2019s announcement last week that the United States would be pulling out of northeast Syria, as well as his equivocation over the conflict with Iran, has left many traditional U.S. allies in the region nervous.\n\nSome such as the Syrian Kurds already argue that they have been abandoned, but the wider implications are still being felt in Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and even Jerusalem. Notably, Russia maintains relations in all those cities, even as it works with rivals in Tehran, Damascus and Ankara, and faces U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe build bilateral relations that rely on positive trends generated by our contacts; we do not build alliances against anyone,\u201d Putin said in a joint interview with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia and RT Arabic that aired Sunday.\n\nPutin\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia and the UAE marks his first state visits to the countries since 2007. It shows continuing warming ties between Russia and the two Gulf States, which were traditionally Western allies with little ties to Moscow during the Cold War and who, until recently, maintained relatively modest trade links.\n\nIt is part of a strategy that puts Moscow at the center of Middle East politics. Putin recently announced that he intends to visit another U.S. ally, Israel, early next year. Embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Russia to meet with Putin last month, just days before a bitterly contested election.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as Israel, had viewed the Trump presidency as a chance to reinvigorate their relationship with the United States. But while they appeared to favor Trump\u2019s decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and other world powers, as tensions across the Persian Gulf grew, there were increasing doubts.\n\nA crippling attack on key Saudi oil facilities last month raised new questions about Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to protect itself, even with its expensive relationship with the United States and the masses of U.S.-made weapons it buys. The United States announced Friday that it would be sending 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia, but the president emphasized the financial aspect of the deal.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d\n\nThe announcement that troops would be sent to Saudi Arabia came as U.S. forces were abruptly pulled out of northeastern Syria, allowing a Turkish offensive that threatened to devastate Syrian Kurds, who had been instrumental in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe U.S. pullout resulted in a last-minute agreement between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Kurdish forces, once on opposing sides of Syria\u2019s long-running civil war. Since an intervention in 2015, Russia has been allied with Assad, providing air power and other support in an often brutal conflict.\n\nRussia had played a key role in three days of negotiations that led to the agreement between the Syrian government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a primarily Kurdish military alliance in Syria\u2019s northeast, a Kurdish intelligence official told The Washington Post.\n\nMoscow has good relations not only with the Kurds and Syria, but also with Turkey. Though Turkey is a member of NATO and an ally of the United States, Russia began deliveries of its S-400 missile defense system to Turkey in the summer, hastening a spat between Ankara and Washington, which suspended Turkish involvement in the U.S. F-35 fighter jet program in response.\n\nThe S-400 system is considered one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, but most U.S. allies have avoided purchasing it for fear of angering Washington. Last month, after the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, Putin jokingly suggested at an event in Ankara with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the kingdom should have purchased the weapons.\n\n\u201cThe political leadership of Saudi Arabia just needs to make a wise state decision,\u201d Putin said, pointing to the purchase of the S-300 missile system by Iran and the S-400 missile system by Turkey. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, also in attendance at the event, was shown smiling after the remark.\n\nRussia ultimately remains far weaker than the United States in a variety of ways. Its economy has suffered greatly under sanctions, and it has suffered a number of humiliating military setbacks in recent years; even its vaunted S-400 system remains untested in real life.\n\nBut with longtime partners Syria\u2019s Kurds finding themselves at odds with Trump\u2019s Middle East plans, and even those with many friends in Washington such as Israel\u2019s Netanyahu unsure of their footing, allies such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE may see Russia as a more reliable alternative \u2014 even if it is opposed to the United States and allied with many of their own rivals.\n\nIn his interview with Arab media outlets on Sunday, Putin emphasized the positives of his relationships with Saudi Arabia and the UAE but made no secret of his government\u2019s ties to Iran and Syria. He said that while his government did not need to mediate, it could play a role.\n\n\u201cWhat you can do is maintain a friendly conversation with them and present some ideas from a friend\u2019s perspective,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI am convinced that as highly intelligent people, they listen and analyze everything they hear.\u201d","55":"THE PROGNOSIS\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Oct. 2. (Andrew Harrer\/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe doorway is narrowing for President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to broker a deal on lowering drug prices as Democrats pursue impeachment \u2014 but neither side has shut the door quite yet.\n\nAdministration officials met early this month with top Pelosi health aide Wendell Primus to discuss the speaker\u2019s drug pricing proposal, for which the Congressional Budget Office released a partial cost estimate on Friday. The White House has notably refrained from criticizing the Pelosi bill \u2014 which would allow the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices for hundreds of Medicare drugs \u2014 even as congressional Republicans slam it.\n\nIndeed, the Pelosi bill contains plenty that Trump might like, including tying some prices in Medicare to lower prices in other advanced economies \u2014 an approach the president has sought as a way to stop foreign \u201cfreeloading\u201d off higher prices in the United States. Lobbyists and wonks say it\u2019s possible to imagine a path forward for Trump and Pelosi, who have both promised to take on the high cost of prescription drugs.\n\nBut what began as a bipartisan effort this year could easily fracture as political tensions rise \u2014 and nothing ultimately happens to reduce the skyrocketing prices borne by American patients.\n\n\u201cA bipartisan deal seems highly unlikely at this point,\u201d said Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations for the liberal patient advocacy group Families USA, adding that \u201cit was only ever going to happen with Trump leaning hard on wary Senate Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that not likely at this point, it is hard to see how a compromise can actually happen,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, progressive voices making the case to not \u2018give Trump a win\u2019 on drugs are only growing louder, meaning even that side is likely to back off.\u201d\n\nBiden and his son Hunter Biden attend an NCAA basketball game in 2010.

Pelosi has said she will continue negotiating on drug pricing even amid the impeachment investigation, but Trump called it a \u201ccamouflage\u201d as she seeks election wins next year.\n\nNancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA.

But it especially wants a ban on rebates drugmakers pay to pharmacy benefit managers and a cap on patient out-of-pocket costs in Medicare \u2014 both of which would raise costs for insurers, not drugmakers.\n\n\u201cI think we would like to see a balanced package emerge from the legislative process this year \u2026 as long as that product is balanced, that we actually solve the problems,\u201d Ubl said.\n\nUbl said it would be \u201cunfortunate\u201d were the impeachment proceedings to derail drug pricing legislation \u2014 and said he thinks there is still room for a bipartisan deal.\n\n\u201cI think both the administration and Congress have a vested interest in some form of legislative accomplishment,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump speaks during a campaign rally at the Lake Charles Civic Center on Friday.

Daniels called the rule \u201cunlawful, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nKen Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, signaled the administration would appeal. \u201cAn objective judiciary will see that this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law,\u201d Cuccinelli said in a statement. \u201cLong-standing federal law requires aliens to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors, and private organizations in their communities to succeed. The public charge regulation defines this long-standing law to ensure those seeking to come or stay in the United States can support themselves financially and will not rely on public benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. immigration laws have long held provisions allowing the government to bar immigrants who are considered at risk of becoming dependent on public support, but the Trump administration\u2019s initiative would expand the types of benefits that could be taken into consideration, including Medicaid, food assistance and federal housing vouchers,\u201d Nick reports. \u201cImmigrant advocates and officials in several jurisdictions have claimed the measures have had a chilling effect even before their implementation, discouraging families from seeking medical care, shelter and food.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Manzanares, 33, was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the University of Utah Hospital in September. (Marisela Trujillo\/Reuters)\n\nOUCH: Federal health officials say some patients sickened with the mysterious vaping-related lung-illness are being hospitalized a second time. Authorities continue to investigate the spate of illnesses that has sickened at least 1,299 people across the country. At least 28 people have died in the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of a handful of patients who have been readmitted for clinical care after discharge for lung injury,\u201d said Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports.\n\n\u201cThe hospital readmissions have taken place as quickly as five days and up to 55 days after discharge, Schuchat said. It\u2019s not known what triggered the relapses. In some cases, patients had resumed vaping,\u201d Lena adds. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that initial lung damage made patients more vulnerable to other illness. Another possibility, she said, is that treatment with steroids, which many clinicians have been using to care for such injuries, may \u2018set you up for increased infection risk.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing a meaningful drop-off in new cases, and unfortunately many more people have been hospitalized with lung injury each week,\u201d Schuchat said during a news conference. Officials still don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the illnesses and she added there may end up being more than one cause.\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\nA man uses a vape device in this illustration picture.

McKinnon reports. It\u2019s the latest probe from lawmakers and officials into how such products are being marketed and sold amid concerns about youth vaping.\n\n\u201cTwo major players, Reynolds American Inc. and Juul Labs Inc. haven\u2019t used bots, according to spokesmen. NJOY LLC also hasn\u2019t used bots, according to a person familiar with the matter. Japan Tobacco International USA Inc. said it hasn\u2019t used bots either. Another firm contacted by the House committee, Fontem Ventures, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment,\u201d John reports.\n\n\u201cSocial-media bots are programmed accounts that automatically conduct tasks such as generating messages and reposting content,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere is nothing inherently wrong with their use, which is widespread on the internet.

(George Frey\/Reuters)\n\n\u2014 A bankruptcy judge ruled to temporarily halt legal action against Purdue Pharma and its embattled owners, the Sackler family.\n\nThe ruling pauses action for three weeks in the numerous state and federal lawsuits against the company and Sackler family members. During that time, the opioid manufacturer \u201cagreed to address one of the key concerns \u2014 access to more information about the Sacklers\u2019 finances \u2014 raised by state attorneys general who objected to including the family in the temporary injunction,\u201d our Post colleague Renae Merle reports.\n\nThe company had initially asked for a 180-day stay. \u201cThe company argued that halting litigation was necessary to allow progress on a tentative settlement with more than 2,600 plaintiffs who have accused Purdue of deceptively marketing its blockbuster opioid pain pill, OxyContin,\u201d Renae reports. \u201cWithout that protection, the Sacklers had said they may back out of the settlement, valued at $10 billion to $12 billion. As part of that deal, the Sacklers agreed to relinquish control of their firm and contribute at least $3 billion to the settlement.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Renae and our colleague Lenny Bernstein wrote last week about why the company chose to file for bankruptcy in White Plains, N.Y., despite being headquartered in Connecticut and incorporated in Delaware.\n\n\u201cLarge corporations have considerable flexibility in choosing where to file bankruptcy.

Hospitals in Dallas and Houston had grown suspicious and filed reports with the state\u2019s child services agency. Child Protective Services removed Christopher and his two half-siblings from Bowen-Wright\u2019s custody in 2017 and closed its case last year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFriday was the end of a long legal battle for Christopher\u2019s father, Ryan Crawford, who fought Bowen-Wright in court for years over custody and was long skeptical that his son was ill.\n\n\u201cShe was always saying Christopher was sick. Every single week. Every single month,\u201d Crawford told the Star-Telegram in December 2017, shortly after Bowen-Wright was arrested. \u201cShe would always say, \u2018Something\u2019s wrong. He has this. He has that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOver the years, Christopher\u2019s mother would claim he had cancer, a genetic disorder and seizures, among other ailments.\n\nBowen-Wright also created online fundraisers for Christopher, the Star-Telegram reported. She organized a bike rally for him in 2014, after claiming he had a rare disease called arteriovenous malformation, with the hope of raising $30,000 for medical treatments. In local coverage of that event, Bowen-Wright told CW 33 that \u201cChristopher has trouble breathing so basically, his lungs \u2014 and body \u2014 doesn\u2019t get the oxygen it needs, so he gets tired; he can\u2019t play as long as the normal kids,\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long Christopher will live with AVM.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt Bowen-Wright\u2019s trial this year, Suzanne Dakil of the Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas testified that Christopher often seemed healthier than his mother claimed and that the unnecessary treatments had actually caused medical complications, the NBC affiliate reported.\n\nCrawford now has full custody of his son, according to NBC.\n\nTexas media reported that Bowen-Wright\u2019s behavior was consistent with a condition known to medical professionals as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which one person falsifies another person\u2019s illness and seeks unnecessary treatments for it.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether Bowen-Wright had been diagnosed with the condition.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe moment I heard about this case a year and a half ago, it seemed like a particularly severe case of Munchausen by proxy, combined probably with what we called malingering by proxy,\u201d said Marc Feldman, a distinguished fellow at the American Psychiatric Association and an expert on the condition.\n\nAD\n\nFeldman said that in cases of Munchausen by proxy, \u201cthe mother is not only after attention and sympathy, but government benefits, disability support, medications. They may be after a whole host of tangible gains as well as the attention.\u201d\n\nThere is debate among the psychiatric community about whether the condition is a form of mental illness or a type of abuse, Feldman said, but children who are subjected to it can suffer serious consequences even if the behavior is discovered. Unnecessary medical treatments can do harm or endanger a child. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are not uncommon among survivors. An estimated 600 to 1,200 cases occur in the United States each year, according to Feldman.\n\nAD\n\nIt takes an average of 14 to 15 months for a case of Munchausen by proxy to be discovered, and America\u2019s decentralized medical system enables perpetrators to bounce from doctor to doctor to avoid suspicion and continue to fabricate stories and diagnoses with each new visit. It is unusual, though, for a parent to take a child to hundreds of different medical visits as Bowen-Wright had, Feldman said, though he added it was not unheard of.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve encountered cases that have gone on for seven, eight, nine years before doctors recognize that it was abuse,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD","58":"\u201cCan you imagine being Somali-American and watching this?\" one person tweeted Thursday. \"This is the kind of hate rally seen in authoritarian and fascist countries.\u201d","59":"\n\nThe author Ali Wong. (Stephanie Gonot)\n\nIf Ali Wong\u2019s preschool-age daughters ever actually read the comedic memoir meant for them, \u201cDear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets & Advice for Living Your Best Life,\u201d they will collect some mighty off-color visuals of dear ol\u2019 mom \u2014 and, uh, best of luck trying to unsee them. Wong\u2019s swaggery comedy is already a trove of now-iconic imagery, like the not-so-maternity mini dresses she wore while hugely pregnant in her starmaking Netflix specials, \u201cBaby Cobra\u201d (2016) and \u201cHard Knock Wife\u201d (2018) (she is donating one to the Smithsonian, and both have become popular feminist Halloween costumes); and the extra-stark realities she shares onstage about life after giving birth, from \u201cbull\u2019s-eye\u201d nipples to exploding milk to, well, actual afterbirth. But in her first book, she paints even more indelicate pictures, in every shade of blue. There is the scene where she pees on her husband, Justin, while he is trimming her pubic hair; the ayahuasca hallucination where she gives herself oral sex; the recurring shtick of splashing water on her nether-regions before a romp; and even the relatively clean, yet still blech-inducing, Biore pore strip she yanks off the nose of her blackhead-infested mother. \u201cThe white piece of paper looked like a hairbrush afterward,\u201d Wong writes. \u201cIt was so deeply satisfying.\u201d\n\nPost-\u201cBaby Cobra,\u201d Wong seemingly exploded into A-list status \u2014 you know, the old \u201covernight\u201d success story of someone who pounded the pavement outside freeway-adjacent motels for years. So for come-lately fans wondering, Where did this tiny filthy phenom come from?!, \u201cDear Girls\u201d fills in the gaps. Wong\u2019s study abroad program to her mom\u2019s native Vietnam, for example, proved culturally and ideologically formative, leaving her with a taste both for exploring the outer limits of her comfort zone \u2014 so crucial to her brand of comedy \u2014 and for eating fertilized duck embryos. \u201cIt was practically still alive,\u201d she writes of first ingesting the delicacy, \u201cbut after that moment I became really intolerant of anybody who got grossed out by something other people in the world ate for breakfast every day. Just shut the [expletive] up and eat a duck baby.\u201d\n\nWong\u2019s skyrocketing success of late \u2014 from selling out mega venues on her Milk & Money tour, to starring in, co-writing and producing the hit Netflix rom-com \u201cAlways Be My Maybe\u201d \u2014 gets lassoed down to earth with humbling, early-years anecdotes about fearing for her life on seedy tours, trying out material in clubs that doubled as laundromats and bombing in front of Eddie Murphy. \u201cI knew Eddie Murphy specifically wasn\u2019t laughing,\u201d Wong writes, \u201cbecause everyone knows when Eddie Murphy is or isn\u2019t laughing.

But as with her stage comedy, she is also sneakily thoughtful about the public roles she occupies \u2014 Asian American, working mom, woman on comedy stages \u2014 and the come-from-behind grind they necessarily demand. \u201cConvincing an audience that a person who looks like me could be funny,\u201d she writes, \u201cand proving to them that I belonged onstage, was a steep uphill battle.\u201d She even offers surprisingly tender takes on her immigrant-minded parents, her sensitive husband (who contributes his own chapter as an afterword) and motherhood, the match that lit her career on fire.\n\nWong\u2019s daughters should consider themselves lucky to have a self-made, cultural touchstone for a mother, let alone one doling out personalized advice about dating rappers, the importance of travel and surefire signifiers of a worthy Chinese restaurant: \u201cThe pork and shrimp will arrive right away, but it takes an hour to get a glass of water.\u201d But if they indeed tuck into this memoir, they will learn more than they ever cared to \u2014 in vibrant technicolor, yikes \u2014 about mom\u2019s sex life. \u201cDear Girls,\u201d and all readers it may concern: In print, Wong is every inch the crass-master she plays on TV, so gird your gag reflex.\n\nRachel Rosenblit is a freelance writer and editor in New York.","60":"Drivers should consider avoiding the area, and those who are in the area should expect delays and the possibility of protesters.

This admonitory greeting isn\u2019t necessarily a turnoff; it just forces you into an un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox posture: I may be wanted here, but not to the extent that others are. How does that make me feel?\n\nWell, if you are even casually acquainted with the concept of injustice, you wrestle against defensiveness and pay attention. Because even though the actors tell you that the rituals of \u201cWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down\u201d are primarily for black audience members, people of any color can \u2014 yes, I think, must \u2014 relate to the anguish flowing through this intense and edifying experience.\n\nAleshea Harris\u2019s performance piece, presided over by an accomplished and impassioned cast of eight, plunges all of its patrons into a river of outrage. America in 2019 remains a den of inequity, insofar as insults to African American hearts and bodies are concerned. In \u201cWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down,\u201d the violence perpetrated against black people by police is the jumping-off point for an exercise that starts in a mournful cataloguing of those insults, passes through stages of anger \u2014 and ends, for some spectators, in tears.\n\nWoolly Mammoth Theatre has brought the production by New York\u2019s Movement Theatre to Washington and, in a smart and embracing gesture, arranged bookings for it outside its own building downtown, at prices as low as $5. The Duke Ellington School of the Arts was its first stop over the weekend; the show travels Thursday to Howard University; and then to THEARC in Anacostia, before settling in for a run at Woolly Mammoth.\n\nThis is a moment in which playwrights of color are shedding the curtain of metaphor and opening stages to plainer talk about America\u2019s racial failures. Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s \u201cSlave Play,\u201d a new sensation on Broadway, pokes fun at the pieties of white liberals who seek to absolve themselves from accusations of racial cluelessness; \u201cSoft Power\u201d by David Henry Hwang, which has its official opening this week at off-Broadway\u2019s Public Theater, explores the branding of never-American-enough with which some Asian Americans say they must contend. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cFairview,\u201d which just ended a run at Woolly, white audiences are challenged even more directly by its author, Jackie Sibblies Drury, who asks that they leave their seats, sit on the stage and confront head-on the cultural divisions that racism has fostered and sustained.\n\nThe least white playgoers \u2014 who remain an overwhelming majority on most nights in the nation\u2019s mainstream theaters \u2014 can do is come and hear them out, these dramatists seem to be saying. Theater has long been receptive to the voices of marginalized artists and groups, on the fringes certainly, and sometimes, even on its bigger stages. In \u201cWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down,\u201d Harris tweaks this open-arms tradition by having an actor inform ticket holders at the door that \u201cWe are glad non-black people are here. We welcome you, but this piece was created and is expressed with black folk in mind. If you are prepared to honor that through your respectful, conscientious presence, you are welcome to stay.\u201d\n\nThe experience you wade into turns out to be meaningful, regardless of your skin color. The first portion is participatory: the audience forms a circle and you are guided through several gentle bonding activities. The eight actors join us. They are Denise Manning, Javon Q. Minter, Beau Thom, Alana Raquel Bowers, Nemuna Ceesay, Rachel Christopher, Ugo Chukwu and Kambi Gathesha. Under Whitney White\u2019s intuitively moving direction, they ask us then to take seats around the space for a performance of barbed skits tallying the daily dignity violations of surviving in white America.\n\nThe audience on my evening at Duke Ellington was equally divided between black and non-black playgoers; you could feel everyone tense up a bit, as the grievances outlined in the storytelling sank in. (The polished actors perform \u201cWhat to Send Up\u201d in street clothes, adding in some a cappella singing and employing a few basic props.) The show culminates in a scene that memorializes the worst of the violations racism continues to engender, especially for young black men.\n\nI saw wet cheeks around the room on black faces, brown faces, white faces. Tragedy conjured on a stage with fire and grace can transfix anyone, regardless of what your life has been like before coming through the door.\n\nWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down, by Aleshea Harris.

But a nationally televised professional wrestling championship had never before seen anything quite like this.\n\nAD\n\nNyla Rose is the first openly transgender woman to be signed by a major U.S. wrestling promotion. And here in her hometown of Washington, Rose was competing in the first Women\u2019s World Championship on the debut episode of a new show, \u201cDynamite,\u201d from All Elite Wrestling, an upstart promotion that aims to compete with WWE with a message of inclusion.\n\nWhen Rose signed with AEW earlier this year, the company and the wrestler played down her gender identity, focusing the story line on her strength in the ring, her imposing size and her Native American heritage.\n\nAs her fandom grew, so did the backlash. Angry messages from wrestling fans emerged in online chat rooms and on Twitter threads, bringing the usual outrage that comes from a transgender woman competing in female sports. Even in a sport that is scripted and performative, some still questioned whether Rose\u2019s placement in women\u2019s matches is fair.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually a little concerned about how she is with the other wrestlers, because for most of her life, she was stronger, proportionately, by a lot.

They want to virtue-signal and say they\u2019re checking all the boxes they have to check.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut for Chris Hirsch, a 32-year-old who goes by the name \u201cFuzzy\u201d and drove 2\u00bd hours from Harrisonburg, Va., with his wife and 7-year-old daughter, it really wasn\u2019t \u201cthat big of a deal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIf it had been a mixed martial arts fight, Hirsch said, \u201cthen I\u2019d have an issue with it. But wrestling is entertainment.\u201d\n\nHirsch said he doesn\u2019t personally know anyone who is transgender. \u201cEveryone has their own opinions on it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s wrestling. Leave it alone.\u201d\n\nDie-hard wrestling fans like Hirsch didn\u2019t come to make a political statement. They came to see punches thrown and bodies flipped. They came to be entertained.\n\nAnd that was exactly what Rose said she had hoped for.\n\nRose knew there might be fans watching who have never known a trans person. With Rose in the ring, \u201cthey can see another way someone lives their life. Something they\u2019re not normally used to,\u201d she said in an interview Wednesday before the show. \u201cSo it eventually becomes not a big deal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor Rose, fighting in such a major ring, in her hometown, is a big deal. A formally trained actress and martial artist of Oneida heritage, Rose grew up watching wrestling on TV with her grandmother in a lower-middle-class home in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington.\n\nAD\n\nShe attended T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, where she was on the wrestling team for one week and \u201chated it.\u201d \u201cIt was not as theatrical as I hoped it would be,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought they were going to let me get a crazy costume and get some entrance music and be all flashy.\u201d She stuck with the drama club instead and eventually entered the independent wrestling scene to pursue a career that combined her love of both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known who I was,\u201d she said about her gender identity. But she didn\u2019t start medically transitioning until she was in her mid-20s, once she had already started wrestling at smaller independent shows.\n\nAD\n\nShe assumed the wrestling world would reject someone like her. But six years ago, she was given a chance to fight with a promotion owned by Cody Covey, Rose recalled to Sports Illustrated. She decided to tell the owner that she was transgender. \u201cHe was like, \u2018That\u2019s cool; I don\u2019t care. Can you wrestle?\u2019 \u201d After the match, Rose broke down in tears. \u201cFor him to have that vote of confidence and just not care, it was in\u00adcred\u00adibly emotionally overwhelming,\u201d she told Sports Illustrated.\n\nIn the years that followed, she continued landing spots in independent promotions on the East Coast and in Japan. In February, she signed with All Elite Wrestling.\n\nOn Wednesday night, she faced a roaring crowd in her hometown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNyla! Nyla! Nyla!\u201d fans shouted.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the Native Beast!\u201d a commentator said, using her wrestling moniker, a nod to her Native American heritage.\n\nA commanding figure, with tattooed tributes to the Legend of Zelda and \u201cGeneral Tso\u2019s chicken\u201d \u2014 in Chinese characters \u2014 Rose grabbed Riho like a rag doll, flinging her around. She lifted the tiny wrestler up in the air, Riho\u2019s legs kicking around.\n\nAt one point in the match, Riho kicked Rose out of the ring and tried diving on top of her. But Rose caught her easily in her arms like a baby.\n\nLater, back in the ring, Riho tried picking up Nyla for a \u201cpower bomb\u201d but failed.\n\n\u201cHer body just collapsed,\u201d a commentator on the live broadcast said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo shortage of spirit, of pluck, moxy or grit from Riho, but Nyla Rose just with a distinct, overwhelming advantage,\u201d a commentator said.\n\nAD\n\nRiho had been training to be a professional wrestler her entire life. And as she drop-kicked and punched Rose, the fans around the ring got onto their feet. It was clear Riho was the \u201cbabyface\u201d of the match, the crowd favorite.\n\nAnd it was clear that, at least according to the AEW script, Rose\u2019s size didn\u2019t matter all that much after all.\n\n\u201cThe fans are really into this one. . . . No matter who wins this, we have been impressed with both these ladies,\u201d a TV commentator said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a match,\u201d said another.\n\nAt the match\u2019s climax, Riho sprinted across the ring, kneeing Rose in the face, stunning her and pinning her down.\n\n\u201cOne, two, three!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nRiho was crowned the winner, the first AEW Women\u2019s World Champion.\n\n\u201cUn \u2014 be \u2014 lievable!\u201d the commentator on the TV shouted.\n\nAD","64":"Throughout my life, I\u2019ve been teased by other women for using pads instead of tampons.

The mentally ill 51-year-old was limp as the male correctional officers delivered the blows, a federal lawsuit alleges. Her head bobbed along the ground, eyes rolled back.\n\nThe Aug. 21 assault at Florida\u2019s Lowell Correctional Institution nearly killed Weimar, and left her a quadriplegic. At the hospital where she has spent the past few weeks, she breathes through a tracheotomy and eats through a tube. She will need round-the-clock medical care for the rest of her life, according to the lawsuit.\n\nNow, Weimar\u2019s lawyer claims in a new lawsuit, the Florida Department of Corrections is trying to wriggle out of paying for that care. Prison officials are seeking to release the injured woman from their custody early, a move that would free them from covering all her medical bills.\n\n\u201cThe only reason she needs any sort of medical care for quadriplegia is as a result of their employees,\u201d attorney Ryan Andrews told The Washington Post. \u201cIn my view, they\u2019ve been playing games with her since this happened.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Corrections said it could release only limited information about the incident, which was first reported by the Miami Herald, because it remains under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that preliminary reports from this incident are concerning,\u201d Mark Inch, secretary of the Corrections Department, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to examining all the details regarding this situation and ensuring appropriate action is taken.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, the agency has denied wrongdoing and asked the judge to dismiss the case.\n\nOfficials have not publicly identified the guards accused of attacking Weimar. Andrews, who filed the most recent lawsuit to force the department to turn over records, said they are still on the job. The Department of Corrections said they have been reassigned to posts that keep them out of contact with inmates.\n\nThe beating was the latest tragedy for Weimar, her attorney said. She showed up at a relative\u2019s house at 6 years old with cigarette burns on her body, he said. She drifted in and out of jail over the years, the Herald reported, arrested on charges including loitering, burglary, prostitution and public drunkenness. At times, she experienced homelessness.\n\n\u201cShe basically spent her whole life on the streets just trying to get by,\u201d Andrews said of Weimar, who is bipolar and has an anxiety disorder.\n\n[She began to talk \u2014 then mysteriously fell silent. Months later her parents learned why.]\n\nShe landed at Lowell Correctional Institution in 2016. The central Florida women\u2019s prison is the state\u2019s largest and country\u2019s second-largest, according to the Herald, which has documented deaths, mistreatment and abuse behind its walls. The facility is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, the newspaper reported.\n\nWeimar was sentenced to serve six years there after pleading no contest to aggravated battery and resisting arrest with violence. The charges stemmed from a 2015 altercation with her ex-boyfriend in Broward County, during which Weimar cut him with a knife.\n\nOn Aug. 21, about eight months into her sentence, Weimar was on work duty. She was tasked with cleaning toilets, but because of a hip condition, told the guards she couldn\u2019t do it. The guards became irate \u2014 and then violent, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWith a bad hip and nothing more than cleaning supplies, (Weimar) was defenseless,\u201d the suit says.\n\nThe guards allegedly slammed her to the ground and hit her in the head, neck and back. They dragged her outside, to an area where surveillance cameras couldn\u2019t record the beating. Other inmates watched in horror and begged other employees to intervene, Andrews said. Some were convinced the guards were beating a dead body.\n\nWhen it was over, one of the prison employees said, \u201cShe was already disabled; they just disabled her more,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nWeimar was taken to Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville. She is being treated by medical providers contracted by the Department of Corrections, confined in a medical wing reserved for prisoners.\n\nWith credit for time served, Weimar is not scheduled to be released until January 2021, records show. But now, Andrews said, the Department of Corrections is considering seeking a medical release so she gets out sooner. His lawsuit claims department employees persuaded her to sign documents she did not understand, which signed over her disability benefits.\n\n[Her case opened the way for people with disabilities to reclaim their freedom. Now, her words open a book that could help countless more.]\n\nIf Weimar were released, Andrews said, the agency would be responsible for only half of her medical expenses, while Medicare would cover the rest. The change would be made through what\u2019s called conditional medical release, a program that allows the Corrections Department to recommend that a commission approve the early release of terminally ill or permanently incapacitated inmates.\n\nAndrews said he is usually supportive of the concept, which allows the imprisoned a chance to spend time with loved ones while they are dying or disabled. But in this case, he\u2019s suspicious of the motivation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good faith,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much good faith you could possibly have here when your employees do this to her.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nConfessions made him the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.

Police forces descended on Barcelona, the Catalan capital, as demonstrators marched on major transit hubs, including the city\u2019s international airport.\n\nAD\n\nCatalan officials attacked what they considered excessively harsh sentences and called on the Spanish government to negotiate a different solution. But Madrid refused to back down and urged respect for the rule of law.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe tended to think that this was something impossible in 20th-century Europe; now we see that it is possible,\u201d Alfred Bosch, Catalonia\u2019s minister for foreign action, institutional relations and transparency, told The Washington Post. \u201cPolitical leaders were condemned to 100 years in jail because they held a vote,\u201d he said referring to the cumulative length of all the sentences.\n\n\u201cRight now, in the heart of Europe, it\u2019s really worrisome and troubling.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, defended the ruling.\n\n\u201cIn a social and democratic state of law, compliance means full compliance,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis has been a judicial process with full guarantees and transparency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Spain will work in the coming days toward guaranteeing public order and protecting our democratic laws as it has always done.\u201d\n\nAt least one Catalan civic group said it would respect the court\u2019s ruling. In a statement, the Catalan Civil Society urged local authorities \u201cnot to call for confrontation.\u201d But others, such as FC Barcelona, one of the world\u2019s most popular soccer teams, objected to the prison sentences. \u201cPrison is not the solution,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nThree other defendants were found guilty merely of disobedience, which means they will be fined but not serve prison time. All 12 defendants were acquitted of the more serious charge of rebellion, but top Catalan officials were given the lengthier sentences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpanish prosecutors initially sought a prison term of 25 years for Oriol Junqueras, Catalonia\u2019s former vice president and the highest-ranking Catalan official on trial. Junqueras was ultimately sentenced to 13 years, the longest the court handed down.\n\nAfter the ruling, Junqueras said Monday that Catalan independence was \u201ccloser than ever.\u201d His comments were relayed by his Republic Left party.\n\n\u201cA total of 100 years of prison. How horrible. Now more than ever, we will be with you and your families. For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia,\u201d Carles Puigdemont, a former regional president of Catalonia, said in a statement on Twitter. Puigdemont fled Spain to Belgium after calling the 2017 referendum.\n\nSpain on Monday renewed its extradition request for Puigdemont.\n\nThe ruling looks set to play a role in Spanish elections in early November, the fourth vote the country has held in four years. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, a Socialist, was unable to form a government after winning a general election in April, largely because of a standoff with smaller parties on the far left and political center.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolitical analysts viewed the vote in the context of Spain\u2019s mounting political fragmentation. There are two political parties in the Spanish parliament that support Catalan independence, and it was unclear how the verdict in the Catalan trial would affect the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either going to get the pro-independence political parties more votes, or people will come to the conclusion that we\u2019ve been through this now, we have a sentence, and they won\u2019t get votes,\u201d said William Chislett, an analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute, a Madrid think tank.\n\n\u201cWhich way it\u2019s going to go is anybody\u2019s guess,\u201d he said.\n\nMcAuley reported from Paris.\n\nAD","67":"\n\nBrothers Andrey, 8, Sergey, 6, Ilya, 7, and Sergey, 14, and mom Larissa, 52 watch TV before going to sleep.

According to Les, the family does not have a lot of money, and they receive 8,000 rubles (around $100) subsidy per child per month. The lack of money also makes it difficult to provide an education for the children.\n\nLife is difficult for the Morozov family.

(Theodor de Bry\/Library of Congress)\n\nThe Lucayan did not know it was Oct. 12, 1492. They did not know that their island, in what would become the Bahamas, had been spotted by Spanish explorers led by a Genoese man named Christopher Columbus. And they did not know that in less than 30 years, their island would be empty from the coming genocide.\n\nAs Columbus and his men approached, the Lucayans greeted them warmly, offering food and water, and \u201cwe understood that they had asked us if we had come from heaven,\u201d Columbus wrote in his journal.\n\nThen he added, \u201cWith 50 men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them.\u201d\n\nSome of them, he noticed, were wearing gold nose rings.\n\n[Christopher Columbus and the potato that changed the world]\n\nColumbus and his crew stayed just long enough to kidnap a few inhabitants, before sailing away to explore other islands filled with indigenous people.\n\nThis year the District of Columbia joins at least five states and dozens of cities and counties in replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. It\u2019s part of a decades-long reckoning with the sanitized version of the European colonization of the Americas.\n\nIn Hispaniola \u2014 what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic \u2014 Columbus encountered the Lucayans\u2019 cousins, the Ta\u00edno. (The Lucayan were a branch of the much larger Ta\u00edno, who were part of the Arawak language group.) Historians disagree on how many Ta\u00edno lived on Hispaniola at the time, with estimates ranging from 60,000 to 8 million. One contemporaneous account from Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas claimed there were 3 million. More about las Casas shortly.\n\nThere Columbus built a fort where he left a few dozen of his crew, killed two people, took more hostages and sailed back to Spain. As soon as they hit cooler weather, the Ta\u00edno began to die, according to Howard Zinn in \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter significantly overselling the prospects for gold to the king and queen of Spain, Columbus returned to Hispaniola with 17 ships and 1,200 men. The men he had left at the fort the year before had all been killed, \u201cafter they had roamed the island in gangs looking for gold, taking women and children as slaves for sex and labor,\u201d Zinn wrote.\n\nColumbus and his crew searched and searched for gold to no avail, so they filled their ships with something else they could sell: people. Of the 500 Ta\u00edno they took \u2014 selected because they were the strongest and healthiest specimens \u2014 200 died on the voyage to Spain. Many more died once they had been sold into slavery.\n\nSo Columbus tried again for gold, but this time he and his men didn\u2019t go looking for it. They ordered all Ta\u00edno people 14 and older to deliver a certain amount of gold dust every three months. If they didn\u2019t, their hands would be cut off.\n\nAt this point, the Ta\u00edno were refusing to grow crops, and those who didn\u2019t bleed to death after their hands were removed began to die of famine and disease. When they fled into the mountains, they were hunted down by dogs. Many killed themselves with cassava poison.\n\nColumbus\u2019s men also continued to sexually abuse Ta\u00edno women and girls. In 1500, Columbus wrote to an acquaintance that \u201cthere are many dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to 10 are now in demand.\u201d\n\nAs the population plummeted, they abducted indigenous people from other islands, like the Lucayan, to work the fields and mines of Hispaniola. When the British colonized the Bahamas in the 1600s, the islands had been deserted for more than a century.\n\n\n\nThis engraving by Joos van Winghe and Theodor de Bry depicts the atrocities committed by Spanish explorers on the indigenous people of the Caribbean described by Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. (Peace Palace Library\/Peace Palace Library, The Netherlands)\n\nBartolom\u00e9 de las Casas arrived in Hispaniola in 1502, when he was 18. For decades, he participated in the mistreatment of the Ta\u00edno and the introduction of enslaved Africans, before renouncing it all, becoming a Dominican friar and confessing what he had witnessed in \u201cA Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies.\u201d\n\nIt is worth quoting him at length. This excerpt is very graphic:\n\n\u201cThey [Spanish explorers] forced their way into native settlements, slaughtering everyone they found there, including small children, old men, pregnant women, and even women who had just given birth. They hacked them to pieces, slicing open their bellies with their swords as though they were so many sheep herded into a pen. They even laid wagers on whether they could slice a man in two at a stroke, or cut an individual\u2019s head from his body, or disembowel him with a single blow of their axes. They grabbed suckling infants by the feet and, ripping them from their mothers\u2019 breasts, dashed them headlong against the rocks. Others, laughing and joking all the while, threw them over their shoulders, shouting, \u2018Wriggle, you little perisher.\u2019\n\nWhen las Casas wrote this in 1542, there were only 200 Ta\u00edno left on Hispaniola. Across the Caribbean, he claimed the Spanish were responsible for the deaths of 12 to 15 million indigenous people.\n\nHistorians usually attribute most of the deaths to the spread of diseases for which native people had no immunity, but recently historian Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez has pushed back against this, arguing that populations were lower than previous estimated, and \u201ca nexus of slavery, overwork and famine killed more Indians in the Caribbean than smallpox, influenza and malaria.\u201d\n\nSoon after Columbus\u2019s death in 1506, Spanish explorers moved on to other islands, like Puerto Rico and Jamaica, and according to las Casas, \u201cperpetrated the same outrages and committed the same crimes as before.\u201d\n\nBy 1650, Zinn wrote, reports indicated the Ta\u00edno were extinct.\n\nBut recent scholarship proves that may not have been the case. Researchers compared the DNA from the tooth of a pre-Columbian Lucayan woman found in a cave in the Bahamas to that of contemporary Puerto Ricans, who are generally thought to be an interracial mix of African, European and Native American ancestry. They found that the Native American component in the Puerto Rican samples was closely related to the Lucayan DNA. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2018.\n\nJorge Estevez, a Ta\u00edno descendant who assisted the research, told Newsweek: \u201cI wish my grandmother were alive today so that I could confirm to her what she already knew. It shows that the true story is one of assimilation, certainly, but not total extinction.\u201d\n\nThe Ta\u00edno also live on in our language \u2014 barbecue, hammock, canoe, tobacco and hurricane are all derived from Ta\u00edno words.\n\n\n\nA pre-Columbian drawing by the Ta\u00edno in a cave in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic.

His team regularly finishes near the top of tournament brackets, winning the Rocket League Championship Series season six finals last year. Arruda has made a career from the game and gained more than 530,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel, where he uploads instructional gameplay montages.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA week before the start of RLCS season eight, The Post tapped into Squishy\u2019s rock-solid understanding of the game\u2019s mechanics to help aspiring players emulate his moves.\n\nPractice with training packs. A lot.\n\nArruda said any serious Rocket League player should spend 30 minutes to an hour training in free-play mode before starting their first match.\n\n\u201cA lot of pros would say the same,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of their time is in free play.\u201d\n\nWhen he was starting out, Arruda said he only practiced in free play because he didn\u2019t have an Internet connection to compete against others. Now, players can utilize all the training packs from Rocket League \u2014 and countless more from the community \u2014 to hone specific skills or run set plays.\n\nAD\n\nArruda\u2019s recommendation: Make the most of it.\n\nUse time in training to focus on controlling the ball in the air and winning it off nearby walls, Arruda said. Fancier moves, such as the \u201cmusty flip,\u201d are fun to master and well-received on the community hubs such as the Rocket League subreddit, but remember there are no style points in competitive matches.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be going for unnecessarily flashy stuff if it\u2019s not going to be useful,\" Arruda said.\n\nWork on different skills in different modes\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready for a match, take a moment to mull over what mode to pick \u2014 whether it\u2019s 1v1, 2v2 or a traditional 3v3 match.\n\nOne-on-one games allow for more opportunities to practice dribbling and ball control. By nature, the matches are a series of 50-50 matchups, and those situations prepare players for the rare occasions when you find yourself with just one defender to beat in a traditional match.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, 2v2 matches help players mitigate risk, Arruda said. One fewer player on the field forces you to play more conservatively on the ball, helping you build up a better instinct for when to challenge the ball and when to drop back.\n\nAnd finally, in a 3v3 match, you\u2019ll want to practice rotating off the ball with teammates. Arruda said two of the most important details to team play are spacing and anticipating the next touch on the ball.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to being able to read the game,\u201d he added.\n\nOn defense, control the ball; don\u2019t clear it\n\nWhen you\u2019re on defense, always dribble or pass the ball out of your half of the pitch.\n\nPlayers can develop bad habits by simply clearing the ball for their opponents to control and bring back. In short, you\u2019ll create a \u201cping-pong\u201d effect where you have few opportunities for a clear shot on goal. As in many sports, possession is key.\n\nAD\n\nOnce you get possession, there are a few ways to put the opposing team on its heels, Arruda said. Take their boost from the back corners and, after that, get the ball in the air to force players to challenge the ball on their heels.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just trying to put them in a position where they\u2019re going to second-guess their decisions every time,\u201d Arruda explained.\n\nAD\n\nWatch the tape\n\nExcelling at Rocket League starts with incremental improvements. Arruda does not recommend using your recent match record as an indication that you\u2019re getting \u201cbetter.\u201d Ranked matches will always place you against progressively better players if you\u2019re winning, or worse players if you\u2019re losing, so using your record can be a bit flawed.\n\nAD\n\nSave a match on your console and watch the tape a month or so later. That way, you\u2019ll be able to see how much you have improved over time. Replays also help show the flow of the game. Use the perspective to your advantage, Arruda said. Watch when you\u2019ve been scored on and why. Try to find trends or gaps in your defense. Often, teams are exposing the same mistake for most of their goals.\n\n\u201cThe thing about pro-level gameplay is you have maybe one to two seconds max with the ball,\" Arruda said. \"So you have to do something within that time period.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nProfessional play in RLCS matches has become a series of \u201cmind games on mind games,\u201d Arruda said, with players feinting off the ball to expose the defense. As soon as you hesitate, it becomes an opportunity for a goal. The best advice Arruda has is to be decisive and fully commit when you\u2019re challenging a ball.\n\n\u201cYou just got to trust your instinct,\u201d Arruda said. \u201cThere is no time to hesitate in this game. You have to be going, like, full speed almost the entire time.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD","72":"This time, players who logged in at 2 p.m. Eastern time witnessed a rocket launch from the Dusty Divot area of the island, which turned into multiple rockets, all zipping around in a manner similar to the rocket that players saw in the first season-ending live event in Season 4.

A devastated Katheryn Strang made \u201clost dog\u201d signs and took daily trips to the local shelter for months, desperate to find her.\n\nOn Friday, Strang finally got the reunion she had been hoping for \u2014 12 years after Dutchess disappeared. A man found the dog under his shed in the Pittsburgh area, almost 1,000 miles from Orlando. He took the shivering animal to a shelter, Humane Animal Rescue. There, a scan of Dutchess\u2019s microchip linked her to Strang, who had since moved to Boca Raton, Fla.\n\nAt the shelter on Friday, Strang cried as an employee handed her the dog she had always hoped would one day return to her. Staff members posted footage of the emotional reunion on Facebook, writing, \u201cThis is why we do what we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDutchess. Hi, baby.

(Steve Mellon\/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\/Associated Press)\n\nNo one knows how Dutchess made the trek to Pittsburgh \u2014 or what she has been doing for the past 12 years. Strang joked that the dog could \u201ctell me some stories.\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t imagine that Dutchess had walked the whole way.\n\nThe dog, who is now 14, was hungry, shaking and \u201cin serious need of a nail trim\u201d when she arrived at the shelter, said Torin Fisher, an admissions counselor with Humane Animal Rescue. She was also \u201ca little nervous about the situation, which, who could blame her?\u201d Fisher said. But otherwise, Dutchess was in pretty good shape.\n\nShelter employees soon found the microchip \u2014 an implanted device that contains a unique number that can be traced back to an animal\u2019s owner. Seeing that Dutchess\u2019s owner lived in Florida, Fisher figured the family must have recently moved to Pittsburgh. Only when she called Strang did she learn \u201chow incredible of a situation it actually was.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole story kind of unfolded while we were on the phone,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cAnd we were equally excited and shocked and surprised.\u201d\n\nStrang had always held out hope that Dutchess might be found, even after so many years. She paid a $15 annual fee to keep the microchip active, saying on Friday that she would have continued that for years.\n\nStill, she was in disbelief as she drove to Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cUntil she\u2019s in your arms, it\u2019s just gut-wrenching,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA puppy trapped by Hurricane Dorian was found alive a month later\n\nA woman posted videos of herself hopping a fence to approach a zoo lion.

At the time, Elias, 18, was stationed in Hawaii and Japan on the USS Rankin, and Ilaine, 19, was back in their hometown of Blackwood, N.J., about 15 miles from Philadelphia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe notes were just so beautifully written,\u201d said Wolke, 24, who also lives in Clarksville. \u201cReading them just made your heart melt.

But they also learned Elias and Ilaine passed away years ago.\n\nWolke did some sleuthing and found two of their children on Facebook. She sent them messages but neither replied.\n\nUndeterred, she then posted a photo of the letters on Weird Secondhand Finds that Just Need to Be Shared, a Facebook group dedicated to unique and odd items found while thrifting.

It wasn\u2019t until a friend sent Wolke\u2019s post from the Facebook group that Murray allowed herself to consider it could be real.\n\nThe sight of her mother\u2019s handwriting on the envelopes left her \u201cliterally shaking,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter messaging back-and-forth, Wolke reached Murray on the phone \u2014 a call that lasted nearly two hours.\n\n\u201cIt was like an instant bond,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\n\nAfter the war, her parents married in 1948 and started a family, she said. They worked at a stocking mill together. Then, Elias went on to work as a machinist for Pennwalt and Ilaine went to work in a sweater mill.\n\nElias died in 1993, and Ilaine moved to a nursing home in 2010, which is when their house in Clementon, N.J. \u2014 not far from their hometown of Blackwood \u2014 went into liquidation, and the bank sold much of her parents\u2019 possessions, Murray said.\n\nMurray had one letter saved from her parents\u2019 wartime correspondence, but neither she nor her siblings knew there were more of their parents\u2019 historic love dispatches. That\u2019s why they were in such shock that the letters turned up for sale years later, several states away.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMurray said she was extremely moved that the two young women found them and were so determined to track her down.\n\n\u201cThere really are nice people still left in the world,\u201d Murray said.\n\nAfter the phone conversation, Wolke and Grant knew they needed to reunite the letters with the Maxwell family but couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else making the delivery from Tennessee to New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe had such an attachment to these letters.

There was laughter and a few tears, before the siblings took Wolke and Grant on a tour of Elias and Ilaine\u2019s hometown. Wolke and Grant wanted to see all the places mentioned in the letters and to hear more about the couple they\u2019d grown so fond of.\n\nThey visited the land that once belonged to Ilaine\u2019s family and the location of Elias\u2019s childhood home. They found out that Ilaine and Elias met as kids and saw where the two would walk together to school.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey heard stories about how Ilaine was shy and reserved, while Elias was outgoing. They were invited to take a look around the Maxwell family home. Several years after the bank took possession of it, Murray\u2019s daughter purchased it back.

They were just lost from this family. They didn\u2019t even know the letters existed.\u201d\n\nMurray said she was grateful to experience her parents\u2019 young love in their own words.\n\n\u201cTo have a piece of my parents \u2014 just to see what their life was like when they were young and in love,\u201d she said.\n\nMurry took a moment to imagine how her parents would have reacted to this story of two strangers unearthing their heartfelt and personal letters.\n\n\u201cI think my mother would probably blush some,\u201d Murray said. \u201cMy dad would be like, \u2018Wow!

(Kiichiro Sato\/AP)\n\nThe log seemed to fall from nowhere, plummeting from the sky to the exact spot where Victoria Schafer was at work with her camera, shooting pictures.\n\nSitting on the stairs beneath a sandstone cliff, the photographer had positioned a group of six high school seniors last month for Labor Day portraits near a waterfall at Old Man\u2019s Cove, one of the most breathtaking locations of Hocking Hills State Park in Logan, Ohio.\n\nThen, almost as quickly as she could snap a photo, the 74-pound, six-foot log came hurtling over the ledge. It fell more than 75 feet off the cliff, striking Schafer as she was engrossed in her work. The 44-year-old mother of four died at the scene.\n\nAt first, the Chillicothe, Ohio, photographer\u2019s death appeared to be a tragic freak accident \u2015 but it didn\u2019t take authorities long to realize that the log didn\u2019t fall on its own. And it was not an accident. The log, somehow, was thrown or pushed.\n\nNow, authorities say they know who did it: two teenage boys.\n\nThe two 16-year-old boys were arrested and charged with reckless homicide in Schafer\u2019s death last week after detectives received a tip about their involvement, the Hocking County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a Thursday statement. The teenagers, who are not being identified because of their ages, admitted their involvement in \u201cforcing the log over the cliff\u201d once questioned by authorities, Hocking County assistant prosecutor Jorden Meadows said.\n\nThe arrests come after weeks of authorities pleading with the perpetrators to come forward and witnesses to assist in the investigation. Announcing a $10,000 reward for information leading to conviction, Schafer\u2019s family begged for answers in her puzzling death.\n\nFamily of woman killed in Hocking Hills sharing details surrounding death WATCH LIVE: The family of the woman killed while taking senior pictures in Hocking Hills is sharing details surrounding her death. http:\/\/bit.ly\/304uysn Posted by WSYX ABC 6 on Monday, September 16, 2019\n\n\u201cIt is shocking,\u201d Terressa Reep, a close friend and neighbor of Schafer\u2019s, told WYSX. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect a healthy vivacious 44-year-old to not come home from a day at the park.\u201d\n\nSchafer, who also worked as a human resources professional at a pet-store operator, had started her own photography business several years ago, capturing everything from underwater photos to sports and school portraits. She and her husband of 21 years, Fritz, were raising four teenagers between the ages of 13 and 19 at the time of her death. Maddie, 16, had learned of her mother\u2019s fatal injury from classmates who called to tell her what happened at the park, Schafer\u2019s sister, Catherine Muth, told reporters at a news conference last month. The oldest, 19-year-old John, received the call from his father.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Is she okay?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018No, she\u2019s dead,\u2019\" John recounted in an interview with the Dayton Daily News. \u201cAfter that, I didn\u2019t really say anything or think at all. I just figured maybe I heard the wrong name on the call, or maybe I was just hearing it wrong.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 3, the day after the tragedy, investigators with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources informed the family that the log did not fall organically from the cliff at Old Man\u2019s Cave. It had somehow been \u201cdislodged,\u201d as John Schafer recounted to the Daily News. At the top of the ledge, investigators discovered the imprint of where the 74-pound log had been, realizing that there was no way the chunk of wood simply could have rolled out of place. Plus, witnesses at the state park that day could recall having seen a group of kids up there.\n\nBut for a while, no one came forward to identify them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really need anything, just some answers,\u201d Fritz Schafer, the photographer\u2019s husband, told WLWT at the time. \u201cI just can\u2019t stop thinking about her.\u201d\n\nFinally, the essential tip came through.\n\nMeadows told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel in West Virginia on Saturday that a mother of a local high school student called the tip line to report that one of the teenage suspects sent a text message saying that \u201che had done something serious at the park with another kid.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the boys confessed, she said.\n\nThe Hocking County coroner, Dave Cumin, told the Logan Daily News that the teenagers are accused of attempting to \u201ccause panic or other harm\u201d in pushing the log off the cliff like \u201ca projectile.\u201d\n\nSchafer\u2019s death is one of numerous incidents in which teenagers have allegedly thrown rocks or other objects over a ledge and killed or seriously injured a person. In October 2017, in a case that\u2019s still ongoing, five Michigan teens were accused of throwing a rock off an Interstate 75 overpass, striking a 32-year-old man on his way home from work as the rock crashed through the windshield. One teen, Kyle Anger, has already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nPeople have thrown concrete, bricks and paint and even a tripod over bridges, but in some of those cases, such as in the March case of a 33-year-old Texas mom killed by a rock dropped onto her car, the perpetrators were not found.\n\nIn Schafer\u2019s case, her sister, Muth, said that if there were one thing Schafer would have wanted, it would be to raise awareness, ensuring this could never happen to someone else\u2019s loved one again.\n\n\u201cOne thing I know to be true is this: Victoria would simply want the result of all this to be increased safety and awareness at all parks; she\u2019d never have wanted to put these kids\u2019 lives \u2014 or any other person\u2019s life \u2014 in danger,\u201d her friends and family wrote on the page \u201cFriends of Victoria Schafer,\u201d which garnered more than 3,000 supporters since her death last month.\n\nOn Friday, John Schafer told the Daily News that if his mother\u2019s death was the result of a bad decision by two teenagers, he would attend their court hearings to urge the judge not to levy a punishment that would ruin their lives.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anybody that understands teenagers making mistakes, it\u2019s my mom and me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was truly just some kids that didn\u2019t know any better or were just being stupid kids, and not anything more than that, I think my mom would understand.\"","79":"Like an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days.

All told, in the week before the launch of the inquiry, Trump averaged 18 tweets per day. In the two weeks following the launch, that doubled: On average, Trump was tweeting three dozen times a day.\n\nHis behavior during a news conference with the Finnish president appeared so erratic to some viewers that a hashtag \u2014 #TrumpMeltdown \u2014 began trending on Twitter. Commentary about the president\u2019s mental fitness ensued.\n\nAD\n\nStaring down impeachment, Trump has seemed to play the role of the nation\u2019s Shakespearean monarch. At a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump boasted about his own fortitude in surviving so many scandals.\n\nRaising his hand and twirling his fingers to point to his right temple, the president mused, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a little different up here. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere is a look at the characteristics Trump has displayed \u2014 and the characters he has inhabited \u2014 since impeachment proceedings began.\n\nMartyr\n\nTrump strode onstage to rapturous applause at a packed arena in Minneapolis Thursday night ostensibly to campaign for reelection in 2020. But he was obsessed instead with the 2016 election, delivering a jeremiad of persecution and self-pity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom Day One, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president cast himself as the ultimate victim of harassment from congressional Democrats, the intelligence community and the media.\n\n\u201cI can do the greatest things in history, and they\u2019ll make them bad to very bad,\u201d Trump decried. \u201cAnd if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it\u2019s like, \u2018Give him the electric chair! That was terrible!\u2019 \u201d\n\nVictimization has long been central to Trump\u2019s political identity, rooting him in the grievance politics of the right and inspiring in his millions of followers a duty to protect the president from any perceived threat. But Trump\u2019s feelings of oppression and persecution have been especially pronounced during the impeachment crisis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Trump tells it, he is the victim of a corrupt, \u201cdeep state\u201d whistleblower who, along with other perceived enemies, has orchestrated a broad conspiracy to claim malfeasance in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 which, in the president\u2019s estimation, was \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201ctotally appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first so-called second hand information \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty,\u201d Trump tweeted last Saturday, deploying his nickname for Schiff.\n\nDriving Trump\u2019s persecution mentality is his undying frustration that his electoral victory in 2016 is undermined by the fact that Russia interfered to boost his candidacy \u2014 and that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.\n\n\u201cI was investigated, okay? Me! Me!\u201d Trump told reporters Oct. 4 at the White House. \u201cIn my campaign \u2014 I ran, I won. I was [investigated]. You won\u2019t say that, will you? I was investigated. I was investigated.\u201d\n\nHeckler\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was another episode of \u201cChopper Talk\u201d \u2014 Trump\u2019s freewheeling question-and-answer sessions with reporters before he boards the Marine One helicopter \u2014 only this time the president was especially agitated. He strode back and forth and sliced the air with his hands.\n\nThen, as Kelly O\u2019Donnell of NBC News asked him to clarify what exactly he was trying to say, Trump gave her The Hand \u2014 five fingers splayed across the lens of her iPhone.\n\nThe gesture was perhaps inadvertent, but the resulting snapshot epitomized Trump\u2019s bullying persona, in which he heckles, belittles and bellows with abandon.\n\nAs has long been his habit, Trump has applied derogatory nicknames to his impeachment antagonists. Schiff is \u201cShifty Schiff,\u201d Pelosi is \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump\u2019s conduct, is \u201cPompous Senator.\u201d\n\nDuring the Oct. 2 news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Trump acted like a schoolyard bulldozer when Jeff Mason of Reuters pressed him repeatedly on a question he did want to answer: What, specifically, Trump sought from Zelensky during a controversial phone call in which he asked him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Trump offered a lengthy digression that failed to answer the question, Mason followed up twice. The second time, Trump was curt.\n\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d he asked.\n\nWhen Mason answered affirmatively, Trump began to badger him, using his perch behind the presidential lectern to order Mason to pose a question to his foreign counterpart.\n\n\u201cDid you hear me? Did you hear me?\u201d Trump angrily admonished Mason, before again urging him to switch topics. \u201cAsk this gentleman a question. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to berate Mason for being part of the \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ccorrupt media.\u201d\n\nThe president never did answer the original question.\n\nAutocrat\n\nIn Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d he is a leader to be obeyed.\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, the president offered that self-assessment in response to criticism of his decision to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria and, in doing so, abandon a longtime critical ally.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nBut the general sentiment also reflected the often defiant posture Trump has adopted while facing impeachment, a \u201cDear Leader\u201d tone more associated with an authoritarian regime than a democracy.\n\nIn defending his call with Zelensky, Trump used a similarly autocratic construction.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThe phrase is one with which the president is comfortable; Trump has asserted he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to do something \u2014 including the absolute right to pardon himself \u2014 over a dozen times since taking office.\n\nProjectionist\n\nAD\n\nIf the Twitterati takeaway of Trump\u2019s news conference with Niinist\u00f6 was that the president was having a #TrumpMeltdown, in Twitter parlance, Trump had a different view of the situation: It was Schiff who was imploding.\n\nAt one point during the East Room event, in response to a question about whether the White House would comply with House subpoenas, Trump accused Schiff of having \u201csome kind of a mental breakdown.\u201d\n\nHe repeated the claim several days later at another White House event, this one ostensibly about the U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement. Referring to previous Schiff comments, in which the Democratic chairman summarized the controversial conversation between Trump and Zelensky using mock dialogue, Trump said Schiff had delivered \u201ca horrible speech\u201d not based in reality, and concluded: \u201cI think he\u2019s having some kind of a breakdown.\u201d\n\nThe tactic is one long-favored by Trump, in which he takes a charge or accusation leveled against him and wields it like a cudgel back on a perceived foe, even in cases where the counterassault may seem hypocritical or preposterous.\n\nNow facing impeachment over a problematic call with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 where he asked Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival as \u201ca favor\u201d \u2014 Trump has rejected the notion that his conversation with Zelensky was anything but \u201cperfect.\u201d Instead, he has accused Biden and his son Hunter of corrupt dealings of their own with Ukraine, despite little evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nFacing the assessment of his own intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping elect Trump, the president has frequently rejected that verdict \u2014 while offering a contradictory theory of his own, supported by no evidence: That Ukraine meddled in the 2016 elections, but with the goal of helping the Democrats.\n\nTrump has even tried to upend impeachment itself, suggesting Pelosi and Schiff should be impeached instead \u2014 never mind that it has been a matter of practice for over two centuries that members of the House and Senate cannot be impeached. He also turned on a member of his own party, Romney, after the Utah senator was critical of him calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201c#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,\u201d Trump wrote, again suggesting his own potential penance be meted out instead to someone with whom he was feuding.\n\nConspiracist\n\nTrump decried the impeachment effort against him as a \u201ccoup.\u201d He accused the intelligence community whistleblower \u2014 as well as the whistleblower\u2019s sources \u2014 of spying on him and committing \u201ctreason.\u201d He described the impeachment process being run by Pelosi and Schiff as \u201ca totally compromised Kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nTo Trump, the impeachment probe is evidence of a plot to remove him from office, part of a dystopian alternate reality he is combating with ominous language and dark proclamations.\n\n\u201cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP,\u201d Trump tweeted on Oct. 1.\n\nSchiff has been a particular target of Trump\u2019s apocalyptic world view. The president has suggested on Twitter no fewer than four times, for instance, that Schiff might be guilty of treason \u2014 a crime still punishable by death.\n\n\u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d Trump wrote in one missive.\n\nHe even brought up the charge while sitting next to the Finnish president, saying of Schiff\u2019s behavior: \u201cAnd some people even say it was treason.\u201d\n\nTrump has spread some of his own conspiracy theories, including that he has been investigated by the Australians, British and Italians, among other foreign governments. He has also suggested that contrary to the assessment of his own intelligence community \u2014 which found that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections in an effort to help him \u2014 it was Ukraine that meddled, hoping to help the Democrats.\n\nPerhaps most ominously, Trump has warned of a civil war. On Sept. 29 \u2014 a day of extreme presidential angst as measured by his near-record output of tweets \u2014 Trump shared with his 65.6 million followers a warning from pastor and televangelist Robert Jeffress from Fox News.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they never will be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nIn moments, Trump seems to understand the peril he faces \u2014 and acknowledges the differing ways he has responded to the impeachment threat engulfing his presidency.\n\n\u201cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable,\u201d he said Monday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. \u201cAnd it\u2019s lucky that I\u2019m the president, because I guess \u2014 I don\u2019t know why \u2014 a lot of people said very few people could handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sort of thrive on it,\u201d he concluded.","80":"Nancy Amons, a longtime investigative reporter at Nashville\u2019s WSMV, had just seven minutes to interview Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while he was in town on Friday to speak to a group about religious freedom. So Amons didn\u2019t waste any time, telling the secretary that she was going to \u201cstart right away with the tough stuff.\u201d\n\nThen, in an exchange that has been hailed as \u201cgutsy,\u201d \u201crelentless\u201d and \u201ca master class in journalism,\u201d Amons pressed Pompeo on the latest news in the controversy involving President Trump and Ukraine. She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani while in Warsaw, and he refused to say.\n\nUndeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that U.S. diplomats thought a relationship between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president was contingent upon Ukraine investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals. That\u2019s when Pompeo lost his cool.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your facts wrong,\u201d he told Amons, shaking his head. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re working, at least in part, for the Democratic National Committee.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s envoy to testify that \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 came from Trump]\n\nPompeo was in Nashville to speak at a conference held by the American Association of Christian Counselors. As Marie Yovanovitch, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified before Congress that she was ousted because of pressure from Trump, the secretary of state joked to the group that it was \u201ca heck of a day not to be in Washington.\u201d\n\nWhile in Tennessee, Pompeo sat for interviews with local reporters. Among them was Amons. A 30-year veteran of WSMV, she has produced investigations that led to federal indictments and state inquiries, and told The Washington Post that she \u201ccan\u2019t think of anything else I would want to do, unless it was being a private investigator.\u201d\n\nSome speculated that Pompeo was expecting easy questions when he sat down with her. Amons thinks that\u2019s likely.\n\nCabinet secretaries in every administration usually enjoy or tolerate these local TV interviews because they assume they\u2019ll be tossed puffball questions compared to network correspondents. Doesn\u2019t always work out like that as @SecPompeo today realized in #Tennessee. https:\/\/t.co\/9dx4WYVTQo \u2014 Steve Herman (@W7VOA) October 11, 2019\n\nPompeo was definitely not expecting 98-mph fastballs from \u2066@WSMVNancyAmons\u2069 https:\/\/t.co\/MZGWvsXmO8 \u2014 John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cPeople do underestimate me a lot because I\u2019m five feet tall and I walk in and I\u2019m this little short blonde,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope to be friendly and polite, and then they don\u2019t see the questions coming, I guess.\u201d\n\nThe conversation between Amons and Pompeo began amicably, as she joked that he had probably done a few thousand interviews and could clip on his own microphone. She opened the interview by welcoming him to Nashville; he smiled while telling her it was good to be there.\n\nThen Amons was ready to move on from the pleasantries. Holding a stack of notes, she launched into a line of questioning about the resignation of senior Pompeo adviser Michael McKinley.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s adding his voice to a number of career diplomats who\u2019ve expressed frustration over what they see as your failure to stand up for government servants \u2014 for servants like Ambassador Yovanovitch who have been caught up in the Ukraine controversy,\u201d Amons said. \u201cDid you do enough to defend the ambassador, privately and publicly, against the smear campaign that was being waged against her, and will you speak to that now?\"\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, you have some of your facts wrong, so you should be careful about things you assert as facts before you state them,\u201d Pompeo responded. \u201cBut more importantly, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work that I\u2019ve done along with my team, other senior leaders at the State Department, to make sure that this institution was functional, preserved and delivering on behalf of America.\u201d\n\nMoments later, when Amons pointed out that he and Giuliani were in Warsaw at the same time, and asked whether they met, Pompeo said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk about who I meet with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to Warsaw for a particular purpose,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was an important mission. We brought together people all across the world to take down the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran. That\u2019s what I worked on on that mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to say whether you met with him?\u201d Amons asked, still determined to get an answer.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Warsaw, I had a singular focus,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cMy focus was singularly on the work that we have done, effective work, to recover from what the Obama administration has done, which is to underwrite the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror. We\u2019ve stopped that, and we\u2019re making real progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re not going to say,\u201d Amons said.\n\nPompeo repeated the same line: \u201cWhen I was in Warsaw, we were working diligently to accomplish the mission to take down the terror regime that\u2019s inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. That\u2019s what I worked on. It was the only thing that I engaged in while I was there.\u201d\n\n[Hunter Biden will step down from board of Chinese firm, his attorney says]\n\nAt that point, Amons asked about the text messages of the U.S. diplomats, and Pompeo made the jab that she worked for the DNC. He told her that her phrasing \u201cdoes a real disservice to the employees and the team at the United States Department of State.\u201d Then he said that the United States has important foreign policy interests in Ukraine, adding that the \u201cthreat from Russia is real and this administration, unlike the previous one, is taking those responsibilities very seriously.\u201d\n\nAmons wrapped up the interview by giving Pompeo a chance to talk about the reason he came to Nashville. Then she told him that she was out of time. He thanked her and quickly left \u2014 this time without the banter that had started the meeting. \u201cI think he liked me less at the end,\u201d Amons wrote on Twitter.\n\nAs she walked out of the interview, she said she felt as though she had gotten \u201ca whole lot of nothing\u201d and wondered what she would even report from it. Then she decided that Pompeo\u2019s refusal to answer questions was the story. She was surprised by his reaction to her questions, describing it as \u201ccondescending.\u201d Still, she didn\u2019t think his DNC comments merited a response.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to defend a personal attack,\u201d Amons said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t worth the time.

(Afp Contributor#afp\/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nLiam O\u2019Brien is a PhD candidate in history at University College Cork and an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland postgraduate scholar.\n\nPresident Trump has greenlighted Turkey\u2019s invasion of northeastern Syria in an attempt to remove Kurdish forces from a strip of Syrian land along the Turkish-Syrian border. This decision has prompted outrage and condemnation from politicians on both sides of the political aisle, as well as the United States\u2019 traditional allies.\n\nThe Kurdish forces in question were crucial in the fight against ISIS, and onlookers fear that Turkey\u2019s military operation will cause yet another humanitarian crisis in Syria. As Turkey\u2019s air force has launched airstrikes, prompting civilians to flee, opponents are scrambling to come up with a way to reverse the Turkish onslaught and protect the Kurds. Some in the region, such as the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have begun to call for the creation of an internationally backed no-fly zone, calls that may only increase after Turkey bombed American Special Forces.\n\nNo-fly zones, which date back to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, are a physical area in which aircraft are prevented from flying by the air power of another, stronger sovereign state or coalition, and while they often have multiple goals, one is usually to protect vulnerable populations from assault. Their history indicates that no-fly zones have unintended consequences and that keeping them limited to a humanitarian mission is often hard, suggesting that they may not be the best solution for the problems in northeastern Syria today.\n\nThe first no-fly zones, created over northern and southern Iraq by the George H.W. Bush administration in the early 1990s, variously served three purposes: civilian protection, containment and a push for regime change.\n\nThe first of these zones, launched in April 1991 as part of the fallout from the Gulf War, covered territory in northern Iraq above the 36th parallel. Encouraged by Bush, Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north had risen up against the Iraqi government as the war ended. The Bush administration, however, was wary of fracturing the anti-Iraqi coalition, which had achieved its mission of repelling Iraq from Kuwait, and of inadvertently partitioning Iraq, which enabled Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime to cling to power. This ambivalence allowed Hussein to begin extracting vengeance on the Kurds and the Shiites rising up to oppose his rule.\n\nThe crisis in northern Iraq soon became so acute that Bush was forced to launch a reluctant but successful humanitarian intervention, Operation Provide Comfort, which spawned the April 1991 no-fly zone. Its purpose was initially to defend British and American pilots as they flew aid to Kurdish refugees. But, as the Bush administration withdrew its ground troops from Iraq, the zone soon took on the role of protecting Kurdish civilians from Hussein. The no-fly zone, policed by regular coalition military patrols, achieved this goal by putting a stop to Hussein\u2019s air force using helicopters against the Kurds, which it had been doing because of poor postwar planning.\n\nBut the no-fly zone was not without unintended geopolitical ramifications. Principle among these was facilitating the emergence of the Kurdistan Regional Government \u2014 a de facto Kurdish state in northern Iraq. This development deeply worried America\u2019s ally Turkey, which feared the separatist impulse among its own Kurdish population. As the base for the aircraft operating the no-fly zone, Turkey\u2019s involvement was key to the operation\u2019s existence, and it often took skillful diplomacy on the part of the Bush administration to keep the deterrent in place.\n\nIn August 1992 the Bush administration created a second no-fly zone, this one over southern Iraq, ostensibly to protect the Shiites from Hussein\u2019s continued vengeance.\n\nWhile both no-fly zones were envisioned as short-term measures, each ended up lasting more than a decade as successive U.S. governments struggled to deal with the Hussein regime. The geopolitical cost was often high: The stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia to run the no-fly zones antagonized powerful forces in the region, including al-Qaeda, helping to precipitate terrorist attacks against the United States.\n\nDespite this high cost, little analysis of the no-fly zones took place. Both at the time and in the years since they have been presented uncritically as straightforward humanitarian interventions. The reality, however, is that no-fly zones were and remain multifaceted tools. Even when they have humanitarian goals, they also have political objectives.\n\nWhile the first northern zone furthered humanitarian goals by limiting Hussein\u2019s ability to persecute Kurds, from the beginning it also allowed the United States and its allies to punish Iraq for its continued refusal to identify and destroy its weapons of mass destruction, despite a United Nations decree ordering that process. The traditional narrative holds that only later, in 1996, did the northern no-fly zone become more about containing Hussein than protecting the Kurds. But in reality the Bush administration had realized early on that the zone represented a significant impingement on Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and freedom of action.\n\nThe punitive potential of no-fly zones was expanded by the creation of the no-fly zone over southern Iraq in August 1992. Again, duel purposes were at work: Bush and his allies publicly voiced concern about the ever-worsening plight of the Shiites, but their main goal was to extract a price for Hussein\u2019s refusal to allow U.N.-mandated weapons inspections. In fact, the new no-fly zone was meant to be just one part of a wider anti-Hussein operation enacted in August 1992, but the plan\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, a significant bombing campaign against Iraq, had to be abandoned after damaging leaks from within the State Department embarrassed the Bush administration.\n\nThe leaks were tied to a third purported goal of the \u201crenewal of hostilities,\u201d as the administration called it: domestic politics. Allegedly, the administration wanted to provoke Iraq into a confrontation timed to coincide with the start of the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston. \u201cWe are going to stage an incident,\u201d one of the leakers claimed, \u201cto help get the President reelected.\u201d\n\nWithout the planned broader campaign, the no-fly zone became the primary new weapon for punishing Hussein. It proved entirely ineffective at protecting the Shiites, who faced a significant ground-based threat. While the northern no-fly zone had protected the Kurds, the geographic and political circumstances were completely different in the south. This difference illuminated how no-fly zones were not a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThat has remained true: Since the Iraqi zones were implemented, only two more no-fly zones have been created \u2014 each by a U.S.-led NATO coalition \u2014 and both produced mixed records. A no-fly zone operated over Bosnia by the Clinton administration proved ineffective at protecting civilians and a 2011 no-fly zone over Libya, created by the Obama administration, has proved to be highly controversial. While justified by the Obama administration on humanitarian grounds, the no-fly zone played a role in the ouster and execution of Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi, prompting charges that it was designed to engineer regime change.\n\nThe sum total of these experiences teaches us that no-fly zones have always had unintended geopolitical consequences. However well-intentioned, a no-fly zone in northeastern Syria could exacerbate problems in the region or produce repercussions for the West, especially the United States. While stopping Turkey\u2019s attack on the Kurds is a worthwhile goal, a no-fly zone offers more risks than rewards.","82":"\n\nA loss to the Jets did not leave Cowboys owner Jerry Jones at a loss for words. (Adam Hunger\/Associated Press)\n\nA lot can change in three weeks in the NFL. Just ask Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, whose team lost its third straight game on Sunday, falling to the previously winless New York Jets in what Jones admitted was \u201ca bloody nose to us.\u201d\n\nAfter his team opened the season with three straight wins, Jones has cast aside thoughts of NFL-wide dominance and, at least for the moment, is looking at the NFC East and calculating how to conquer it, starting with Sunday\u2019s game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Both teams are 3-3.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s all about where you end up in your division,\u201d Jones told reporters Sunday evening at MetLife Stadium. \u201cI think the competition against each other and the competition within the division, I think that\u2019s where it all is.\n\n\u201cNow, ultimately, if you\u2019re one of the really top teams, which we\u2019re not, we are not \u2026 I hope that someday this season we could be one of the top teams. We certainly were not tonight. I hope that we can do better than just win our division, although I\u2019ll take that right now in this circumstance. But I hope that we can get out there and get a little special positioning in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys and Eagles go into Sunday night\u2019s game at AT&T Stadium tied atop the division, with the Giants at 2-4 and Redskins 1-5. At the moment, the Cowboys hold the tiebreaker because of a better record in the division, but the season isn\u2019t halfway over yet and the first round of divisional matchups hasn\u2019t been completed.\n\n\u201cThis was a big game for us,\u201d Jones said of the 24-22 loss to the Jets. \u201cEvery one in your division is big, but this was a big game. We could\u2019ve been 4-2 \u2026 I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re 5-0 and 1-4. We suffered another loss because of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bloody nose to us.\u201d\n\n[John Clayton: These five NFL contenders are at risk of missing the playoffs]\n\nThe loss fell on the 77th birthday of a man who has made no secret that he wants to win a Super Bowl ASAP and it marked the first time since 1999 that the Cowboys had lost to an opponent with an 0-4 or worse record. It also marked the Cowboys\u2019 first three-game losing streak since late in the 2017 season.\n\nAs eager as he is to get to a Super Bowl, Jones said that Coach Jason Garrett\u2019s job isn\u2019t in jeopardy. Garrett has gone to the playoffs three times in nine seasons, but has never gotten past the divisional round.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be very trite. I was a lot happier with what he had done the first three games than what\u2019s happened the last three games,\u201d Jones said, \u201cbut the big thing I want to say is it\u2019s not just him. This is across the board. That had a lot of input out there tonight to get in that spot.\u201d\n\nGarrett is in the last year of his contract and Jones has shown no inclination to change that. Told last week that oddsmakers ranked Garrett behind only Atlanta\u2019s Dan Quinn on the list of coaches likely to be fired, Jones replied, \u201cDon\u2019t bet any money [on] that happening. You\u2019ll lose it.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys\u2019 offense has been slowed by injuries on its vaunted offensive line, among other things. Their record is the same was it was last year after six games, but expectations were higher this season.\n\n\u201cIf you really look at it, you can\u2019t take one thing. It can be a list of 15 things, with some having more of an emphasis on maybe the player, the execution, mistakes, breaks \u2014 all of those kinds of things,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAcross the board, we did not play well enough to win. Had we been able to tie this thing up, or win that thing at the end, it wouldn\u2019t be because we played well. You guys would be writing about a team that did not play well that won a game. Instead, you\u2019re [writing] about a team that what usually happens to you when you don\u2019t play well.\n\n\u201cAm I thinking that this is what we are going to be or what we can do with our 10 games that we have remaining, here we are leading the NFC East? Not at all. I want to look at the things that we\u2019re doing right, and we\u2019ll give a good look at making the adjustments or whatever the things that haven\u2019t gone good here.\u201d\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nThe 49ers are for real, and the Rams are in real trouble\n\nThis Redskins fan paid $1,600 to fly a \u2018Fire Bruce Allen\u2019 banner.

Robert Wise, our director, had envisioned an aerial shot to be filmed from a helicopter that would discover me \u2014 a speck in the vast alpine landscape \u2014 walking toward the camera. He selected a beautiful stretch of countryside high in the mountains, flanked by woods on two sides. Our huge playback speakers were camouflaged among the trees, as was our crew, so that no one else was in view.\n\nI was placed at one end of the meadow. A helicopter hovered behind the trees at the other end, waiting for me to begin my walk toward it. Initially, I couldn\u2019t hear my cue since the crew\u2019s voices were muffled by the trees. Even the playback, turned up as loud as possible, was almost inaudible over the \u201cclackety-clack\u201d of the helicopter. Finally, Marc Breaux was given a bullhorn, through which he yelled, \u201cGO, JULIE!\u201d\n\nI began my walk, and as I did, the helicopter rose up and over its cover. It came at me sideways, looking rather like a giant crab. A brave cameraman named Paul Beeson was hanging out of it, strapped precariously to the side where a door would have been, his feet resting on the runners beneath the craft. Strapped to him was the heavy camera equipment. As the helicopter drew closer, I spun around with my arms open as if about to sing. All I had to do was walk, twirl, and take a breath. This required several takes, to be sure that both the helicopter and I hit our marks correctly, the camera was in focus, there was no helicopter shadow, and that everything timed out. Once the take was complete, the helicopter soared up and around me and returned to its original position. At that point I\u2019d run back to the end of the field to start all over again, until Bob was satisfied that he had the perfect take.\n\nThe problem was that as I completed that spin and the helicopter lifted, the downdraft from the jet engine was so powerful, it dashed me to the ground. I\u2019d haul myself up, spitting mud and grass and brushing it off my dress, and trek back to my starting position. Each time the helicopter encircled me, I was flattened again.\n\nI became more and more irritated\u2014couldn\u2019t they see what was happening? I tried to indicate for them to make a wider circle around me. I could see the cameraman, the pilot, and our second unit director on board, but all I got was a thumbs-up and a signal to do it again. Finally, the shot was deemed acceptable, and I was grateful to return to my hotel and take a long, hot bath.\n\nBy this time, largely due to the weather, we were three weeks behind schedule, seriously over budget, and the studio had summoned the rest of the cast back to L.A. We tried to capture the next small section of the song for several days, but the relentless rain thwarted our attempts yet again. Day after day, we waited for a break in the clouds, everyone cold, damp, and longing to go home.\n\nThere was still quite a bit left to shoot, as each small segment of the song was its own little scene. The brook, for example, was actually man-made, dug out by our crew, lined with plastic and filled with water, boulders, and ferns. Our host farmer lost patience with us, claiming that the film crew\u2019s presence was disrupting his cows\u2019 milk production. Overnight, he took a pitchfork to the plastic lining and punctured it enough times that all the water drained away. Bob was devastated\u2014the 20th Century Fox bigwigs were hounding him to wrap things up, but they had no idea of the obstacles that he was wrestling with.\n\nFinally, Bob promised the studio that if he didn\u2019t get the last shot he was waiting for, he\u2019d wrap the company nonetheless and come home the following day. By some miracle, that afternoon the clouds parted for a brief half hour, the sun came out, and we got our shot. Bob later said that those constant lowering cumuli set against the magnificent Alps gave the film the drama and authenticity it needed \u2014 something we couldn\u2019t have achieved any other way.\n\nFrom the book \u201cHome Work\u201d by Julie Andrews.

His wonderful book, \u201cHow to Catch a Mole,\u201d is a beautiful, elegiac ode to a remarkable creature. It\u2019s also an exploration of Hamer\u2019s life as he approaches his sunset years. Each page is filled with wonder, love, regret, humility and a sense of wonder (and oneness) with nature.\n\n\u201cHaving worked all my life, created a family, discovered a home, I feel as secure as a working-class man ever feels,\u201d he writes. \u201cI feel a sense of equality again with the crow and the toad and the hawthorn, with the rain and wind. I am them and they are me. . . .. I am just another animal, another tree, another wild flower in the meadow among billions of others. . . . There is something deeply magnificent in being just ordinary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow to Catch a Mole,\u201d could be used as a guide to ridding a pest, but it\u2019s first a fine work of nature writing. Like all the classics of the genre \u2014 J.A. Baker\u2019s \u201cThe Peregrine,\u201d Eugene Marais\u2019 \u201cThe Soul of the White Ant\u201d and John Lewis-Stempel\u2019s \u201cMeadowland\u201d \u2014 it teaches us to look at the natural world anew, to develop eyes for the overlooked or the unseen. The book also delivers, via its furry central character, some useful life lessons.\n\nA mole can hear a human coming a half-mile away and when its tunnels are breached, it can sense the change in air pressure. Alert! Danger is afoot! \u201cIf a mole comes across something it doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Hamer writes, \u201che either digs it out and pushes it to the surface, or he blocks the tunnel and digs around the problem. Undefeated, he makes more molehills. He is a master of survival strategy, the first rule of which is \u2018Take a detour around the dangerous thing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nClever mole. In \u201cThe Wind in the Willows,\u201d he wears glasses for a reason. So a molecatcher needs patience, quietude and shrewdness. These are qualities Hamer has in abundance. At 16, Hamer left home, and over the course of the next 18 months, walked across Britain, honing the skills that make him a superlative mole catcher \u2014 invisibility and placidness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen laying a trap, he made the mole\u2019s home appear as undisturbed \u2014 and palatable \u2014 as possible. \u201cI try hard to give him the world he wants,\u201d Hamer explains, \u201cthe one he expects and feels comfortable in.\u201d\n\nThe great sadness of Hamer\u2019s career is that he loves the animals whose lives he ended. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy killing, so my methods had to be efficient, detached, fast and technical,\u201d he writes. You get a sense that a small part of him died every time he trapped a mole. But Hamer became a molecatcher to assure himself the work was done humanely.\n\n\u201cIn my early days as a gardener I was concerned that the few molecatchers I had come across showed little sensitivity, and that creatures were suffering. Looking back, of course, I have no idea what they felt. I judged them to be brutal men, but I am no different, not any more: the hammer shapes the hand, and I am moulded by the life I chose.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHamer is retired now. He refuses to kill moles anymore. He will, for a fee, advise people how to do it themselves, though he wishes they\u2019d leave them be, as they do in Germany and Austria, where the European mole is a protected species.\n\nRead Hamer\u2019s wondrous book, then explore your yard.

Defenses are matching up more in man-to-man coverage against Kansas City, and Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson burned the Chiefs\u2019 porous run defense as well as through the passing game Sunday. Still, the Chiefs are clearly the most talented AFC West team and will win the division. Coach Andy Reid will find a way to run the ball better and make life easier for Mahomes.)\n\nAD\n\nBut what about the remaining five? We ranked them from most cause for concern, to least.\n\n1. Los Angeles Chargers\n\nThey dropped to 2-4 after a Sunday night loss to a Pittsburgh Steelers team starting its rookie third-string quarterback \u2014 a stunning fall for a team that was 12-4 a season ago, averaging 27 points per game and allowing just 20.\n\nAD\n\nBut the past two weeks have exposed so many problems. First, you start with the injuries. You can\u2019t expect to lose left tackle Russell Okung, center Mike Pouncey and safety Derwin James to injuries, miss halfback Melvin Gordon for four games with a holdout and wait for five weeks to get back tight end Hunter Henry from a knee injury and expect a repeat of a 12-win season.\n\nThe Trent Scott-Sam Tevi tandem at offensive tackle isn\u2019t working out. The receiving corps has been banged up. Rivers is struggling in the red zone and the offense is averaging 20 points a game and has been shut out in the first half of the past two games.\n\nAD\n\nTo make matters worse, the Chargers are 1-3 at home with a three-game losing streak and have had more opposing fans at their games than Charger fans. The AFC provides more opportunity to catch up in the playoff race than the NFC does, but the Chargers have reason to worry.\n\nAD\n\n2. Los Angeles Rams\n\nAfter a 3-0 start, the Rams have fallen to third place in the NFC West and are on a three-game losing streak. More concerning is how the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers have caught up to them after they had such a position of dominance in the division.\n\nThe 49ers totally neutralized Sean McVay\u2019s offense in Sunday\u2019s 20-7 victory at the Coliseum. McVay still hasn\u2019t found answers to the problems defenses have caused for them since the Detroit Lions put up a six-man defensive front against them last year in early December \u2014 a model the Patriots replicated in their Super Bowl victory. Take away the running attack, and you take away the key to an offense that can score more than 30 points a game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, the 49ers primarily used a four-man rush to limit the Rams to 109 meaningless yards rushing and held Jared Goff to 13 of 24 passing for 78 yards. Todd Gurley was out with a groin injury, but when healthy he\u2019s been bad in pass-blocking and hasn\u2019t had more than 16 carries in any game this year.\n\nThe Rams clearly look like the third-best team in their division \u2014 something no one would have expected even three weeks ago.\n\n3. Chicago Bears\n\nAt 3-2, the Bears are still in a strong position to make the playoffs, but they have to worry about the competitive NFC North, with all four teams having winning records. The Green Bay Packers really improved their pass rush with the additions of Preston Smith and Za\u2019Darius Smith, and of course, they have Aaron Rodgers at quarterback.\n\nAD\n\nChicago feasted on the league\u2019s easiest schedule during last year\u2019s 12-4 campaign, but this year it has one of the four toughest. The offensive line has struggled and quarterback Mitchell Trubisky was up and down before suffering a clavicle injury. The Bears could have a tough time earning a wild-card spot if the Packers run away with the division title.\n\nAD\n\n4. Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles (tie)\n\nI put these two teams together because they are both 3-3 and face each other next Sunday night. The loser will drop to 3-4. That\u2019s a problem, because the combined records of their next six opponents are 22-8 \u2014 meaning the team that doesn\u2019t win the NFC East could have a hard time earning a wild-card bid.\n\nAD\n\nFor the Eagles, the biggest problem is injuries, particularly on defense. Starting cornerbacks Ronald Darby and Avonte Maddox are hurt and cornerbacks Rasul Douglas and Sidney Jones have been inconsistent in coverage. They are thin at linebacker and banged up along the offensive line.\n\nFor the Cowboys, the answer appears to be simple: We\u2019ve overhyped them. They started the season 3-0 against teams that had combined records of 3-14. Offensive coordinator Kellen Moore was able to get away with more creative plays than this offense has seen in years because the defenses they faced weren\u2019t any good. Over the recent three-game losing streak, the Cowboys are averaging 19 points a game, after averaging 32 the first three games. Injuries at offensive tackle haven\u2019t helped, and the defense, which is very talented, is simply giving up too many yards and points.\n\nAD\n\nThis is the third straight year the Cowboys are 3-3 after six weeks under Coach Jason Garrett, who is in the final year of his contract.\n\nAD\n\nAround the NFL\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the Cleveland Browns are 2-4. I was on their sideline for their 32-28 loss to Seattle, and it\u2019s clear that they are their own worst enemy. They suffer way too many self-inflicted wounds on offense. Maybe it\u2019s unfair, but much of that points back to first-year coach Freddie Kitchens.\n\nThe offensive line, which isn\u2019t good, commits too many penalties that put Baker Mayfield into tough down-and-distance situations. Pass-catching has been inconsistent despite having Pro Bowlers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry. Balls keep bouncing off the hands of Cleveland pass catchers and into the hands of defenders.\n\nCleveland has a bye week followed by a road game at New England followed by a schedule that gets much more manageable in the second half. With team owner Jimmy Haslam being at recent practices, you have to wonder if Kitchens will make it to a second season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe hot seat just got hotter for Atlanta Falcons Coach Dan Quinn. The Falcons are 1-5 after a 34-33 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. While a coaching change might not happen in the next week, something could happen by their bye in Week 9. The Falcons have home games coming up against the Rams and the Seahawks. The defense is giving up more than 30 points a game.\n\nAfter six weeks, Russell Wilson is the league MVP. He is carrying a team that is still figuring things out on defense to a 5-1 start. On Sunday, he patiently brought the team from behind to win at Cleveland. He\u2019s completing 72.5 percent of his passes for 1,704 yards and has 14 touchdown passes and no interceptions.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming clearer there will be QB changes in Carolina, Tampa Bay and Tennessee. With Cam Newton out with a foot injury, Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen won his fourth consecutive start in London to beat the Buccaneers, 37-26. Newton is 0-8 in his past eight starts. In a 16-0 loss to the Denver Broncos, Titans QB Marcus Mariota was benched in favor of Ryan Tannehill. Jameis Winston threw five interceptions and had a lost fumble in the loss to Carolina, bringing his career total to 87 turnovers. Odds are narrowing for Mariota and Winston getting contract extensions. They are free agents after this year.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cDuck\u201d Devlin Hodges story isn\u2019t quite Gardner Minshew mania, but it\u2019s close. Pittsburgh\u2019s rookie third-string QB only threw the ball further than 10 yards downfield twice all game, but he was nonetheless impressive in a 24-17 win over the Chargers. The smart coaching move was putting him into the pistol formation on occasion, and letting the running game do the heavy lifting.\n\nOn the broadcast, NBC estimated that roughly 80 percent of the fans in L.A.\u2019s stadium were Pittsburgh supporters. On the season, road teams are 51-40-1 leaguewide. The NFC continues to dominate interconference play with a 19-10 record, even after the New York Jets\u2019 win over Dallas.\n\nRead more:","86":"\n\nPresident Trump speaks to members of the media at the White House on Saturday. (Al Drago\/Bloomberg News)\n\nDaniel Hemel is an assistant professor of law at the University of Chicago.\n\nA federal appeals court in Washington on Friday ordered President Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm to hand over stacks of financial documents to congressional investigators. When that dispute reaches the Supreme Court later this year, the justices will face a crucial choice: whether to schedule oral argument promptly and pave the way for a final ruling by summertime, or instead delay a decision until after next year\u2019s general election.\n\nThe high court should not let Trump run out the clock. But if a bare majority of the justices wished to, they could.\n\nThe case involves a subpoena issued April 15 by the House Oversight Committee to the president\u2019s accountants, Mazars USA, for financial statements they prepared on behalf of Trump, his trust and foundation and several Trump-owned businesses from 2011 through 2018. The subpoena also calls for \u201c[a]ll underlying, supporting, or source documents and records\u201d that the accountants used when producing those statements. That demand potentially encompasses Trump\u2019s long-elusive tax returns if Mazars relied on them when preparing his statements.\n\n[Trump just gave the House a very good reason to look at his tax returns]\n\nSeven days after House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) sent the subpoena to Mazars, Trump sued his accountants in federal district court in Washington to stop them from complying with the congressional demand. Judge Amit P. Mehta made quick work of Trump\u2019s claims, ruling on May 20 that the subpoena was enforceable immediately. Trump sought relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and the appeals court put Mehta\u2019s ruling on ice temporarily while it took up the case. It, too, proceeded at a fast clip, holding a rare summer oral argument on July 12 and issuing its decision just shy of three months later.\n\nWithout strong legal arguments and with the general election fast approaching, Trump\u2019s best strategy now is to stall. D.C. Circuit rules give Trump 30 days to ask for a rehearing before the three-judge panel that initially decided his appeal or before all 11 active judges on the circuit court. It\u2019s unlikely that the panel or the full circuit will grant Trump\u2019s request, but 30 days from last Friday, the general election will be less than a year away.\n\nOnce the D.C. Circuit resolves the rehearing petition, Trump will have \u2014 according to the appeals court\u2019s order \u2014 seven more days before Mehta\u2019s ruling takes effect. During that window, the president will scramble to obtain a stay either from the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court. He will argue that the ruling against him should be placed on hold while he petitions the justices to hear his case. His lawyers will say \u2014 not unreasonably \u2014 that without a stay, the case would become moot because Mazars would have to hand over the documents to Congress before the justices could weigh in.\n\nIf he obtains the stay, Trump may well have won his war against time.\n\nThe losing party in a lower-court case has 90 days to file a certiorari petition, potentially allowing Trump to wait until late February to seek Supreme Court review. And that\u2019s not all, because the court typically takes several more weeks to consider amicus briefs, the winning party\u2019s response, and the losing party\u2019s reply before it decides whether to grant the petition. Washington\u2019s cherry blossoms may be in full bloom before we even know whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.\n\n[Trump lied to me about his wealth to get on the Forbes 400. Here are the tapes.]\n\nAt that point, the next opening on the Supreme Court\u2019s regular oral argument schedule will likely not be until the beginning of the next term, Oct. 5, 2020, when early voting will have started in several states and the general election will be just four weeks away. By the time the court releases its opinion, Trump either could have already taken the oath of office a second time, or he could be out of the White House and licking his electoral wounds at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut such delay need not be destiny. The justices can allow Trump\u2019s lawyers to idle \u2014 or they can put the case on a much faster timetable and resolve it well before voters must decide whether to reelect the president.\n\nIf the justices choose to move quickly, the case could proceed as follows. When Trump\u2019s lawyers seek a stay from the Supreme Court, the justices could \u2014 as they did in Bush v. Gore \u2014 construe the stay application as a petition for certiorari and grant review immediately. (Alternatively, they could deny Trump\u2019s stay application and his request for further review \u2014 concluding that Mehta and the D.C. Circuit have given his arguments all their due \u2014 though they may decide, not unjustifiably, that a high-profile dispute between the president and the legislature ought to be resolved finally by the highest court in the land.)\n\nThe justices could then order the parties to file briefs on an expedited time frame and hold oral argument this winter. That would allow for a final decision well before the court\u2019s summer recess, which typically begins in late June or early July. If the justices rule in the House\u2019s favor, then the Oversight Committee would have plenty of time to review Trump\u2019s financial documents and decide what should be released to the public before the election.\n\nThere is ample precedent for this accelerated approach. In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the Supreme Court issued its final decision a little more than two weeks after the first district court hearing. In United States v. Nixon in 1974, just over three months passed from the special prosecutor\u2019s subpoena for the White House tapes and the Supreme Court\u2019s final ruling. In Bush v. Gore, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush asked the Supreme Court for a stay on a Friday, and the court heard oral argument the following Monday and issued its decision on Tuesday. The wheels of justice usually turn slowly, but the court can spin them much faster when the stakes are high and time is of the essence.\n\nWhether the court speeds up its consideration of the Mazars case will have subtle but significant implications for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. If the Supreme Court allows itself to be used by Trump to stave off congressional inquiries, then the practical power of the presidency will expand even if the ultimate decision goes in the House\u2019s favor. If the justices act quickly to resolve document disputes between the president and lawmakers, then the court will enhance the efficacy of congressional oversight and bolster an important check on executive branch misconduct.\n\nLegally, there is little that the House can do to force the high court\u2019s hand. Public opinion can, however, judge the justices based on their pace as well as the result they reach. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is increasingly the swing vote on a sharply divided court, no doubt knows that this case will be central to the legacy that he leaves. Upholding the House\u2019s subpoena power will help Roberts counter charges that he has been too pliant to this president \u2014 but only if his court reaches its result in time for it to matter.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy California\u2019s plan to get Trump\u2019s tax returns won\u2019t work\n\nFive myths about Trump\u2019s income tax returns\n\nTrump\u2019s impeachment defense boils down to this: Treat me like a king","87":"\n\nPresident Trump walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn at the White House on Thursday.

In previous Fox News interviews, he said Trump had shown \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden but said nothing has risen to the level of being criminal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything close to an impeachable offense here,\u201d Starr said.

Schiff, should be \u201carrested for treason,\u201d a 53-year-old mother of four in Wisconsin retweeted Trump\u2019s post to her few hundred followers and added her own take.\n\n\u201cSHIFTY SHIFF NEEDS TO BE HUNG,\u201d wrote Jean Spanbauer, a onetime supporter of President Barack Obama. She had adopted Trump\u2019s epithet for the California Democrat, slightly misspelling his name.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, my tweets are pretty passionate,\u201d Spanbauer, who uses a different name online, said in an interview, adding that she doesn\u2019t specifically wish anyone physical harm. \u201cIt hits very close to home for me. What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\u201d\n\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \u2014 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that threatens Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Isaac Stanley-Becker\n\n9:25 a.m.: Several document deadlines set this week\n\nIn addition to scheduling several depositions, House investigators have set deadlines this week for documents related to the impeachment inquiry for several people and government agencies. Some of those are all but certain to be ignored, given the White House\u2019s letter last week saying it would not cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nHouse Democrats have set Tuesday as the deadline for documents from Giuliani, Vice President Pence, the Department of Defense, and the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDuring an appearance Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark T.

They have helped Giuliani with his investigation of the Bidens.\n\nFriday, meanwhile, is the deadline for documents from the White House and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

He has already tweeted several times about impeachment, but apparently he will not be commenting in person about the proceedings before Tuesday.\n\n8 a.m.: Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser to testify in impeachment probe\n\nHill is expected to speak to House investigators behind closed doors Monday at 10 a.m. about how the administration\u2019s Ukraine policies were influenced by Giuliani\u2019s efforts to have the country investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\nHill served as the president\u2019s top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council from mid-2017 until the week before Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke in a July 25 phone call that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nA transcript of the phone call shows that during the exchange, Trump asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor,\u201d requesting Ukrainian officials look into a debunked conspiracy theory regarding the 2016 election and the energy company Burisma, which paid Hunter Biden to sit on its board.\n\nHill will be the third high-ranking current or former diplomat that the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees will depose as part of their accelerating impeachment probe.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian\n\n7 a.m.: ABC News says Hunter Biden interview will air on Tuesday\n\nABC News announced that it had interviewed Hunter Biden over the weekend at his Los Angeles home and said portions of the interview would begin airing Tuesday morning.\n\nTrump has been relentless in making unsubstantiated claims that Hunter Biden was involved in corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China and has made an issue of his recent public silence. Biden said through his lawyer Sunday that will step down from his position as a board director of a Chinese company this month and promised not to do any work for foreign firms if his father, Joe Biden, is elected president.\n\nThe former vice president has stood by his son and said he would be a part of his presidential campaign.\n\n6:45 a.m. Trump renews call to disclose whistleblower\u2019s identify\n\nTrump on Monday renewed his call to unmask the whistleblower and seized on comments by Schiff suggesting that House Democrats may not press the anonymous U.S. intelligence official to testify in person before Congress.\n\nIn morning tweets, Trump also continued to insist that the whistleblower did not accurately describe the phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when the United States had withheld military aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn fact, the whistleblower\u2019s account closely tracks a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nSchiff, who had originally suggested it was important for the whistleblower to provide closed-door testimony, backed off that stance during an appearance Sunday on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that we already have the call record, we don\u2019t need the whistleblower who wasn\u2019t on the call to tell us what took place during the call,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe have the best evidence of that.\u201d\n\nIn Monday tweets, Trump also renewed his complaint that Schiff offered an embellished version of the call with Zelensky during a recent hearing. Schiff said that he remarks were intended to be in part parody and that Trump should have recognized that.\n\n\u201cDemocrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Cheney says impeachment a factor in Turkish invasion\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 Republican in the House, on Monday argued that the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry was a factor in the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Cheney said that abandoning Kurdish fighters allied with the United States would have negative consequences but suggested Democrats were partly to blame for Trump\u2019s announcement that he wouldn\u2019t impede the Turkish invasion.\n\n\u201cI think that what we\u2019re seeing happen is going to have ramifications not just in the Middle East but around the world if our adversaries begin to sense weakness, if our adversaries begin to think we won\u2019t defend our allies, that we won\u2019t defend our interests, that\u2019s provocative,\u201d Cheney said.\n\n\u201cBut I also want to say that the impeachment proceedings that are going on and what the Democrats are doing themselves to try to weaken this president is part of this. There was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border, and I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage they\u2019re doing with the impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\n6 a.m.: The impeachment crisis shines a spotlight on Trump\u2019s state of mind\n\nHe was hectoring and imperious. He was domineering and defiant. And he was audacious and cavalier.\n\nIn the nearly three weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened an impeachment inquiry, President Trump has struck a posture of raw aggression. His visceral defenses of himself \u2014 at the most vulnerable point of his presidency \u2014 have shined a spotlight on Trump\u2019s state of mind.\n\nLike an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected \u2014 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \u2014 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker\n\n5 a.m.: Trump highlights Fox News host saying serial killers get more due process\n\nTrump on late Sunday quoted a Fox News host saying that serial killers get more due process than Trump is receiving during the impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cSerial killers get more Due Process than the Democrats give to the President of the United States,\u201d Trump tweeted, sharing a quote attributed to Mark Levin, host of \u201cThe Mark Levin Show.\u201d\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trump had urged his more than 65 million Twitter followers to watch Levin\u2019s broadcast Sunday night, calling it \u201ca big show tonight on the Democrat\u2019s Impeachment Scam.\u201d\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) took issue with Trump\u2019s later tweet, writing: \u201cQuote cited by @realDonaldTrump is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an impeachment investigation, the House acts like a grand jury.

More than a dozen of the parishioners\u2019 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\n\nAD\n\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob.

At one point, he grabs someone who represents the Black Lives Matter movement in a chokehold and shoots that person in the head.\n\nAfter shooting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Vice News, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\u2019s neck.\n\nAD\n\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and later assaults Hillary Clinton with a gun.\n\nAD\n\nThe video comes to a dramatic end when Trump jams a sharp wooden stake through the head of a person whose face is a CNN logo.

A neighbor told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he dialed a non-emergency line and requested a welfare check when he noticed that the door was ajar and the lights were on.\n\nWhile searching the outside of the house, police said, an officer saw someone standing near a window. \u201cPerceiving a threat the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside the residence,\u201d police said.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to police, who said the officers provided emergency medical care.\n\nBody-camera footage released by police Saturday shows two officers walking quietly around the side of the house and peering through two screen doors, then moving down a driveway into a backyard.\n\nOne officer approaches a closed first-floor window and shines a flashlight inside, then swiftly raises his gun. \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d he yells. A split-second later, he fires a shot through the window. He does not identify himself as an officer in the footage.\n\nAlong with the video, police released images of a firearm officers said they found at the scene, but did not indicate whether Jefferson was holding the weapon or positioned near it when the officer opened fire. Officials did not release the officer\u2019s name, describing him only as a white male who has been with the department since April 2018. He will be placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, according to the department.\n\nThe shooting comes at a time when relations between law enforcement and black residents in the Dallas and Fort Worth area are already under strain following the recent trial of Amber Guyger, a white former police officer who shot and killed her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, in 2018.\n\nEarlier this month, following an emotionally charged courtroom saga that drew nationwide attention, a Dallas jury convicted Guyger of murder and sentenced her to 10 years in prison for killing Jean, whom she shot after mistaking his apartment for her own. Days after the sentencing, Joshua Brown, a key witness in the case, was shot and killed, stoking rumors that he was targeted because of his testimony. Police attributed Brown\u2019s death to a drug deal gone bad and emphatically denied a connection to the Guyger case, but that has not quelled concerns from some local officials and activists, who have called for an independent investigation, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\n[The Amber Guyger case has sparked emotional fallout across Dallas]\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the officer who shot Jefferson will face criminal charges. Police said they will turn over body-camera footage and other evidence from the scene to the Tarrant County district attorney\u2019s office, which will decide whether to prosecute.\n\nLee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney in the Dallas area who said he is representing Jefferson\u2019s family, said the officer never should have opened fire. Jefferson was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when she heard what she thought was a prowler outside the bedroom window, Merritt wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. When Jefferson went to the window to see what was happening, he wrote, the officer shot her.\n\nMerritt described Jefferson as a \u201cbeautiful peaceful woman\u201d who had graduated from Xavier University of Louisiana and worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales.

The site\u2019s creator, a user known by his Internet handle, Carpe Donktum, scored an Oval Office meeting in July with Trump, who reportedly welcomed him as a \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCarpe Donktum confirmed in a Twitter message Sunday to The Washington Post that \u201cThe creator of the video is, and will remain a contributor to my site MemeWorld.\u201d Carpe Donktum declined to identify the video\u2019s creator citing concerns that the person may face online or in-person harassment.\n\nAD\n\nAlex Phillips, organizer of the American Priority Festival and Conference, told the Times the video was played at one point during the three-day event that began Thursday as part of a \u201cmeme exhibit.\u201d The violent parody was included in a meme compilation that also featured Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign logo, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cIt has come to our attention that an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19,\u201d a statement posted to the conference\u2019s website said. \u201cThis video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe statement went on to note that the conference \u201calways has and always will condemn political violence.\u201d\n\nPhillips told the Times the \u201cmatter is under review.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Post early Monday, the Trump campaign distanced itself from the video.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,\u201d campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.\n\nPeople close to Trump, such as former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr., were also scheduled to speak at the conference and told the Times they were not aware of the edited footage.\n\nThe video\u2019s massacre scene opens with the Trump figure walking down the center aisle of a packed church. More than a dozen of the parishioners\u2019 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\n\nAD\n\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob. He pulls out a black gun from his jacket\u2019s inside pocket and shoots a person edited to represent late actor Peter Fonda, who was a vocal critic of the president, in the head from point-blank range.\n\nAD\n\nThen, chaos ensues.\n\nTrump takes down Bloomberg, Vox and \u201cFake News\u201d in quick succession before shooting Politico. At one point, he grabs someone who represents the Black Lives Matter movement in a chokehold and shoots that person in the head.\n\nAfter shooting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Vice News, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\u2019s neck.\n\nAD\n\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors. He stabs actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell and repeatedly punches Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He goes on to shoot MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and later assaults Hillary Clinton with a gun.\n\nAD\n\nThe video comes to a dramatic end when Trump jams a sharp wooden stake through the head of a person whose face is a CNN logo. A now-grinning Trump appears to survey the carnage as DJ Khaled\u2019s song, \u201cAll I Do Is Win,\u201d plays in the background. A pair of pixelated black sunglasses are lowered onto Trump\u2019s face.\n\nBy late Sunday, \u201cKingsman\u201d was trending on Twitter with many expressing outrage at the video and calling on Trump to condemn it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the President have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \u2014 but it is by far and away the worst,\u201d CNN said in a statement shared on Twitter.\n\nThe images in the recent video are \u201cvile and horrific,\u201d CNN said, adding, \u201cThe President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhite House Correspondents\u2019 Association President Jonathan Karl of ABC News also denounced the video, noting that Trump has been warned that \u201chis rhetoric could incite violence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWHCA Statement on video depicting President Trump murdering journalists. pic.twitter.com\/52lHFaQjU2 \u2014 WHCA (@whca) October 14, 2019\n\nKarl\u2019s statement was supported early Monday by Cindy McCain, who tweeted that the images in the video of the president killing the media and her late husband \u201cviolate every norm our society expects from its leaders.\u201d\n\nTrump has made it a habit to publicly lambaste the media, individual journalists and his critics, leading to heightened concerns about safety. In 2017, the president was widely criticized for tweeting a similarly edited video that showed him body slamming a person with a CNN logo for a face during a pro wrestling match. Earlier this year, Cesar Sayoc, a devoted Trump supporter, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 13 pipe bombs to high-profile Democrats, several of whom were featured in the recent video, and CNN.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, journalists and political commentators suggested the church video is further evidence that Trump\u2019s words have influenced his supporters.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is an incitement to violence that didn\u2019t just come from the dark corners of the Internet \u2014 it was shown at a pro-Trump conference at one of his resorts,\u201d tweeted Politico reporter Andrew Desiderio. \u201cI\u2019m speechless.\u201d\n\nCNN commentator Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas wrote, \u201cTrump has legitimized hate.\u201d\n\nEnablers choose to deny it, but this is the kind of crap Trump peddles & inspires.

According to an NPR review of the movie, the fictional congregation was \u201cclearly modeled on the Westboro Baptist Church,\u201d a Kansas-based organization known for its anti-gay views.\n\nAD\n\nStill, others wondered if the video represents, as one person put it, \u201cthe country hitting rock bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have enough mass shootings, we have enough journalists killed in the line of duty around the world \u2014 we don\u2019t need to glorify a massacre of people who challenge Trump,\u201d Times columnist Nicholas Kristof tweeted. \u201cThis demonization of opponents and fetishization of violence is unconscionable.\u201d","92":"Yet that\u2019s what appears to have happened to the woman on Sunday, according to advocates who had spoken to the woman\u2019s family, as authorities drove her to a nearby hospital. The agents stayed with her inside the emergency room for nearly five hours on Sunday, refusing to budge even as doctors and nurses came to ask her questions and give her medication.\n\nAD\n\nThomas Kennedy, who filmed a series of videos documenting the incident, told The Washington Post that the incident raises questions about the line \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 between immigration enforcement and emergency medical care.

For nearly five hours, the agent stayed put, either inside the room where the woman was being treated, or right outside an open door.\n\nA spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Monday morning.\n\nAD\n\nCBP\u2019s written policies note that its officers, which includes Border Patrol, should call an ambulance when a detainee starts experiencing a medical emergency, such as a heart attack or trouble breathing. At least one agent must follow the ambulance until medical officials decide if they need more attention, according to CBP policy.\n\nAD\n\nThe rule provides little clarity about what should happen if and when a detainee is hospitalized. Besides documenting the incident, an agent must \u201cfollow their operational office\u2019s policies and procedures,\u201d the guidelines say. A detainee\u2019s private medical information must be protected and \u201cdisseminated only to those personnel with a legitimate need to know.\"\n\nKennedy charged that didn\u2019t happen.

Two years earlier, a woman was put into deportation proceedings when she presented fake ID at a gynecologist appointment in Houston.\n\nIn Florida, the woman faced a fate that advocates said can cause similar sorts of fearmongering, or put others seeking treatment in the hospital at risk: Once she was released from the Aventura facility, Border Patrol put her back in their vehicle and drove her away, Kennedy said. As of late Sunday night, her family and lawyers were still trying to locate her.\n\nImmigration enforcement just escorted a patient out of @AHMCAventura.

It's my day to spend time with my dogs, get things done around the house, or just sit around and watch old movies if that's what I want to do. My aunt texted me in a panic and asked me to come over and fix her TV last Sunday. I told her I couldn't do it that day but could do it the next day. She agreed after some begging and guilt-tripping.\n\nBut I was still questioning myself two hours later. Would it really have been so bad to go over there for an hour? Well, yes, because I would have had to put off my housework and dig my car out of the snow just to fix a TV \u2014 and there's another working TV in her house.\n\nSo why do I continue to feel guilty and think about it after the fact? This happens pretty much every time I say no to someone.\n\n\u2014 Feeling Guilty\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis\/For The Washington Post)\n\nFeeling Guilty: When the only way you know to set boundaries is through reading and a few \u201caha\u201d moments and some deliberate new steps, it means you were raised not to have them and instead to say yes to everything because you were afraid you\u2019d be punished for it, if only through people not liking you for saying no to them.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of emotional training to have to undo. So be patient with yourself. The guilt problem might just go away with practice.\n\nAlso give some thought to what triggers these spasms of guilt. What if your aunt had just said, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s great \u2014 thank you so much!\u201d Would you have felt any guilt afterward for not dropping everything on the spot to go help?\n\nI\u2019m guessing not. And that means you can do something to accelerate your progress toward living guilt-free: Recognize that you still feel the effects of other people\u2019s expectations.\n\nSo, you\u2019ll need to reinforce your own conviction that you\u2019re entitled to choose how you use your time \u2014 and others aren\u2019t. This is the bedrock on which all good boundaries rest: the certainty that it isn\u2019t selfish to have them.\n\nJust because panicky aunts have expectations of you, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to meet them; remind yourself of that whenever you feel people tugging at you from the other side of your boundary.\n\nIt can also help to keep an eye out for people who don\u2019t guilt-trip you, and to reserve any special leave-the-house-on-Sunday kindnesses for them. Reward the behavior you appreciate, not the behavior that dredges up lingering feelings of guilt.\n\nRe: Guilt: What helped me was realizing the people in my life were used to guilt-tripping me all the time, because it worked! You are not just changing your habits, you are changing theirs. It is difficult to do, but you will be happier in the long run, and everyone, not just you, will adjust!

After they face the New England Patriots next Monday night, the Jets will meet the Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, New York Giants, Washington Redskins, Oakland Raiders, Cincinnati Bengals and then Miami again, teams that are a combined 8-26. Jets wideouts Jamison Crowder (available in 48 percent of fantasy leagues) and Robby Anderson (41 percent) are solid pickups if they are still available, as is quarterback Sam Darnold (73 percent). For more on Darnold, see below.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are some intriguing options on this week\u2019s waiver wire, ranked in order of scarcity.\n\nKansas City Chiefs defense\/special teams (Available in 56 percent of fantasy leagues)\n\nYes, really. The Chiefs defense isn\u2019t helping Andy Reid win games, but it might help you. Before Sunday\u2019s loss to the Houston Texans, the Chiefs produced three or more sacks in three of their previous four games. Next week, they face a Denver Broncos team that is scoring a below-average 1.6 points per drive with a corresponding below-average passer rating (87.4). Denver also comes away with a red-zone touchdown on less than half its trips inside the 20-yard line (47 percent). This is a matchup play, but the matchup is favorable.\n\nAD\n\nIto Smith, RB, Atlanta Falcons (Available in 61 percent of fantasy leagues)\n\nSometimes it pays to have a touchdown vulture on your roster, and this season Smith fits the bill. The second-year pro leads the Falcons with four goal-line carries, although he\u2019s only scored on one. He\u2019s also caught 11 of 14 targets for 87 yards out of the backfield.\n\nAD\n\nIn the Los Angeles Rams, he will be facing a defense that has allowed touchdowns on six of 20 goal-to-go carries, tied for second-most in the NFL. Don\u2019t worry that Smith had just three carries for six yards in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Cardinals.\n\nDeebo Samuel, WR, San Francisco 49ers (Available in 67 percent of fantasy leagues)\n\nAD\n\nSamuel has the second-most targets on the team after tight end George Little, and now will get to test a Redskins defense that allows 39.8 fantasy points per game to wide receivers, seventh worst in the NFL. Washington\u2019s defense has also surrendered 10 touchdown catches to wideouts, the second most in the NFL.\n\nSam Darnold, QB, New York Jets (Available in 73 percent of fantasy leagues)\n\nDarnold returned to the Jets\u2019 lineup on Sunday and helped lead New York to a 24-22 upset victory over the Dallas Cowboys, completing 72 percent of his passes for 338 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. His upcoming game against New England is obviously a must-sit, but after that the Jets\u2019 schedule is very favorable to passers. According to Sharp Football Stats, no team faces an easier strength of schedule from Weeks 8 through 14 than the Jets.\n\nJordan Wilkins, RB, Indianapolis Colts (Available in 87 percent of fantasy leagues)\n\nWilkins, whose team was off this week, is getting a larger share of the Colts\u2019 rushing snaps (19 carries for 125 yards) and some passing plays (two targets) at the expense of Nyheim Hines. Neither will supplant Marlon Mack as the primary starter anytime soon, but Wilkins does lead the team in yards per carry after contact this season.\n\nIf not for now, then certainly consider him for the future. Indianapolis will play the Denver Broncos in Week 8, Miami Dolphins in Week 10 and Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 11, three teams that have struggled against the run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnthony Miller, WR, Chicago Bears (Available in 88 percent of fantasy leagues)\n\nMiller has run 82 of his 102 routes out of the slot, catching six of 11 targets for 55 yards. Five of those targets came in Week 5 against the Oakland Raiders. The New Orleans Saints are up next. Saints slot corner P.J. Williams has allowed slot receivers to catch 16 of 22 targets for 209 yards and a touchdown, per Pro Football Focus, resulting in 1.6 yards per route run and a 117.4 passer rating against, both metrics placing Williams among the worst slot corners this season.\n\nCincinnati Bengals defense\/special teams (Available in 97 percent of fantasy leagues)\n\nThis is a Hail Mary play for desperate fantasy owners. The Bengals\u2019 defense has struggled this season but Cincinnati\u2019s next opponent, the Jacksonville Jaguars, isn\u2019t a formidable adversary. The Jaguars are below-average offensively (1.7 points per drive, ranking 22nd); struggle to sustain drives (they\u2019ve gone three-and-out 35 percent of the time, ranking 24th); and fail to convert red-zone opportunities into touchdowns (they\u2019ve done so 39 percent of the time, ranking 29th).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAD","95":"Approaching its 150th birthday Nov. 6, college football has developed a hefty share of ancient truths.

Mukuamu\u2019s 53-yard interception return just before halftime not only stemmed from Javon Kinlaw\u2019s rush toward Fromm, and not only provided a 17-10 lead that stuck around a long time, but featured Mukuamu lurching skyward to his left to snare the ball, then staying in bounds before making his merry trip up the sideline. The second, with 9:25 left, involved an outstretched snare with a stunning turn of dexterity at keeping the ball above the grass.\n\nThe third, a reacting catch off a tip, happened in the first overtime, which was handy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic player and uncharacteristic,\u201d South Carolina Coach Will Muschamp told reporters about his towering cornerback, who switched from safety this past offseason and once tweeted: \u201c6\u20194\u201d playing corner? Yeah I\u2019m about to change the game!\u201d Further, Mukuamu credited his teammates by telling reporters that Georgia had \u201cnever played a D-line like us,\u201d the kind of crazy-confident comment that can occur in only about 130 of the 130 Football Bowl Subdivision programs.\n\nStill further, here are some biographical morsels about a defensive player: The family moved from South Carolina to Louisiana, where Mukuamu finished high school, then the three-star recruit committed to Florida State, then Jimbo Fisher left Florida State for Texas A&M, then Mukuamu headed for South Carolina. Here\u2019s what Mukuamu, a polite man and an eager student, told South Carolina reporters in August: \u201cI remember one time in third grade, I had a C, and my mom, actually my parents, didn\u2019t let me play football that year.\u201d\n\nSometimes, a third-grade C can wind up ruining an Athens night.\n\nThat three-touchdown-underdog South Carolina got outgained 468-297, and out-possessed 36:04-23:56, and out-snapped 95-68 proved again how turnovers do matter so much in American life and added further shock to the only occasion Saturday that altered the College Football Playoff landscape up ahead.\n\n[College football winners and losers: LSU proves formidable and relentless]\n\nElsewhere, entertaining form held. LSU and its dazzling new passing game ought to be ranked No. 1 after surpassing Florida, \u00ad42-28, on a Baton Rouge night in which the impressive teams included LSU (6-0) and Florida (6-1). LSU quarterback Joe Burrow completed 21 passes in but 24 tries, and the LSU denizens, for so long forlorn without the fun passes thrown in other towns, looked positively rapturous as star wide receiver Ja\u2019Marr Chase streamed up the right sideline on the 54-yard touchdown that closed the scoring.\n\nOklahoma (6-0) looked fascinating while beating Texas. Alabama (6-0) won at Texas A&M but left Coach Nick Saban prattling about the \u201crat poison\u201d of complacency from the praise that comes from those who see Alabama and notice excellence. Baylor found 6-0 with a double-overtime win over Texas Tech that provided the fans\u2019 dream of a controversial call (on an apparent Baylor fumble in the first overtime), as controversial calls alleviate the tedium of everyday conversation for weeks and months to come while providing much-craved pique. Wisconsin (6-0) continued such steely command with its 38-0 wallop of faded Michigan State, and Minnesota (6-0) continued such steady growth in its 34-7 wallop of Nebraska, so does all that mean there might come a humongous Paul Bunyan Axe game Nov. 30 in Minneapolis?\n\nThere might.\n\nIt certainly means that Wisconsin at Ohio State on Oct. 26 looks plump with pregame anticipation, and it certainly spurs a reminder, especially after a week in which Minnesota prepared for game-time cold by dousing its players with wintry water as they took the practice field.\n\nReminder: Many have dismissed Minnesota Coach P.J. Fleck as a flake, and if a guy who led Western Michigan to a 13-1 record and a No. 1 national ranking in turnover margin, and now has Minnesota at 6-0, is a flake, then may we all seek flake-dom.\n\nStill, at another long day-and-night\u2019s end, the deepest truth lurked somewhere in that presumably merry night in Columbia, the South Carolina capital. Yes, it\u2019s eccentric that there\u2019s a sport that draws hundreds of thousands of people to stadiums to witness conclusions that so often seem foregone. Yes, Georgia held a \u00ad51-18-2 lead in that border rivalry coming in. Yes, as Georgia has revved up under its alumnus Kirby Smart, seemingly rendering post-Spurrier South Carolina a map dot again as Georgia alumnus Muschamp started out, and the past four meetings had gone 52-20, 28-14, 24-10 and 41-17.\n\nYet without all those realities and all that time apparently wasted spent traveling to, parking for and watching them (except at tailgates, where time is never wasted), the upset of Saturday would not have mattered with such oomph. A country that considered the noon matchup an afterthought would not have known the pleasure of being amazed.\n\nThat\u2019s even given that Georgia still can access the playoff, the way these national champions did: Ohio State in 2014 when it lost to Virginia Tech, Alabama in 2015 when it lost to Mississippi, Clemson in 2016 when it lost to Pittsburgh, Alabama in 2017 when it lost to Auburn. And that\u2019s even given Saturday\u2019s downer of an ending, when the great Georgia senior kicker Rodrigo Blankenship missed a 42-yard field goal on the last play. That led the winning coach, Muschamp, to begin his postgame comments with: \u201cRodrigo Blankenship is and has been an unbelievable representative of the University of Georgia and kicker, and my heart goes out to him in losing in that fashion. He\u2019s an outstanding young man and about all the right things in college athletics.\u201d\n\nOn so many Saturdays in college football, you wake up and you know what will happen, but then some Saturdays, it turns out you don\u2019t. Some days, a program standing 18-51-2 against another goes and finds its nemesis at one of its historic peaks yet wins inexplicably, with three interceptions from a giant named Israel and one gracious comment from an underdog coach about a distinguished kicker.","96":"A few factors contributed to this placid acceptance of my postpartum shape: the euphoria of having just birthed a human; the hazy gloss of sleep deprivation from laboring overnight; and, most importantly, the fact that my baby now desperately needed nourishment from me. In that moment, the only thing I judged my body on was its ability to feed Audrey.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, this mind-set held. I wasn\u2019t surprised that my anorexic thoughts didn\u2019t appear. I didn\u2019t even register their absence. I\u2019d heard about the high caloric needs of breast-feeding women, and I ate. I did things that I never would have if my anorexia weren\u2019t dormant. I ate immediately upon waking, rather than making myself \u201cearn\u201d food first. I ate in bed. I ate doughnuts. Years of experience had conditioned me to expect self-flagellation after such indulgences. Normally, I would\u2019ve forced myself to wear my skinniest pants afterward, both to prove that I could still fit into them and as penance, the feeling of the waistband digging into my flesh acting as a reminder that I had erred. Instead, I wore flowy dresses and didn\u2019t think to scrutinize my profile in reflections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy new attitude was rewarded with each pediatric checkup, as our daughter grew in pounds and inches, her percentiles steadily rising. She started to fit into her baby clothes, and what clothes I fit into was of no importance. I looked in the mirror and saw a mother, a woman providing vital nutrition to her child. I didn\u2019t poke the soft flesh of my stomach. I forgave my thighs for touching one another in bed. I chuckled at my suddenly enormous breasts. My baby was growing, my milk was flowing and that was what mattered.\n\nThis sudden freedom from the tyranny of anorexia may have been brought on by the breast-feeding itself. According to Christie Caggiani, a Florida-based dietitian and therapist specializing in eating disorders, the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates milk letdown, is linked to a sense of calm that can be helpful in mitigating eating disorder-related stress. She also says that breast-feeding provides an opportunity for building relationships and connection, something that\u2019s often \u201cpainfully missing\u201d for those struggling with eating disorders.\n\nI\u2019d like to say that breast-feeding, and being a mother, was a permanent cure for my anorexia. But after a few months, things changed. The metabolic requirements of breast-feeding outran my food intake and I started to lose weight. This is a well-documented phenomenon \u2014 many mothers cite accelerated weight loss as a breast-feeding benefit \u2014 but for someone with an eating disorder, it\u2019s not an innocuous side effect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuddenly, I fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans. Strangers commented that they couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d just had a baby. My anorexia woke up. I began scrutinizing what I\u2019d been doing effortlessly for months, and questioning whether I really needed to be eating so much, gradually subtracting food and adding exercise. Before long, the pre-pregnancy pants didn\u2019t just fit me; they fell off me.\n\nThe potential reasons behind this shift are manifold. I now had to convince myself to eat for someone who was outside my body, a much more difficult notion to internalize than eating for a human I was growing inside me. Caggiani also says that eating disordered behaviors tend to spike during times of transition, and let\u2019s just say that going from a responsibility-free life in Brooklyn to motherhood in Sacramento was not an imperceptible change for me. Carla Manly, a California-based clinical psychologist, told me that \u201cthe anxiety-inducing periods of pregnancy and postpartum\u201d often worsen an eating disorder, despite a mother\u2019s best efforts to prioritize her newborn.\n\nMy husband raised concerns, and I scheduled a call with my old dietitian, in the hopes that she could talk some sense into me. She did, to a certain extent, scaring me straight by telling me that breast-feeding while underweight could set me up for osteoporosis later in life, and that even if I produced enough milk, doing so at a low weight meant the milk could be leaching harmful elements such as mercury from my body.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut at that point, the train was out of the station. I\u2019d decided, with the absurd but impenetrable logic of a person with an eating disorder, how many calories I could eat per day, and I would not exceed that number despite my ravenous hunger, fatigue or loose clothes. That old anorexic exceptionalism exhorted me: you can do both. You can lose weight, exercise through hunger, fit into the smallest size and still give your baby the sustenance she needs.\n\nAnd for a while, I could. Until I couldn\u2019t. When my daughter was just over five months old, my milk production plummeted. There are any number of reasons it happened. We cut out night feedings. We took a five-day trip without my pump. Or maybe it was just my body\u2019s natural time to stop \u2014 there\u2019s no \u201cnormal\u201d when it comes to how long a woman produces milk postpartum. Regardless, it became clear that my daughter was not getting the food she needed. When she wouldn\u2019t take formula, I panicked. Instantly, the cacophony of eating disordered thoughts silenced and the important things came into stark relief. It didn\u2019t matter that my arms looked skinny in a photo \u2014 my baby had been hungry. I longed for the poochy bulge of my postpartum belly. I resolved to eat an enormous dinner, as if that would fix everything.\n\nWe soon found a formula my daughter took, but those two days of panic made it clear that anorexia had distorted my priorities. As Caggiani says, \u201cbelieving that breast-feeding alone can be motivation to move someone into recovery is dangerous and misleading.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is, of course, fine to taper off breast-feeding at five months. Many women never breast-feed, and their babies grow into vibrant, healthy adults. Still, I\u2019m working to get back to the place where I was when my daughter was born, when maternal love and responsibility swept away the clutter of eating disordered thoughts.\n\nI may never get my milk supply back up, and she may never again be dependent on me for sustenance, but if I want my daughter to love and respect her own body, I need to do the same to mine.\n\nKate Willsky is a writer living in Sacramento.

The teen girl whom Jenkins thought he had been corresponding with was actually an undercover cop.\n\nAccording to the Oshkosh Northwestern, Jenkins had previously caught the eye of local law enforcement. In 2011, while living in Oshkosh, Wis., he was charged with two counts of repeated first-degree sexual assault after two boys, ages 7 and 8, told police Jenkins had touched them inappropriately and threatened they would get in trouble if they told anyone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJenkins reportedly denied the allegations, telling investigators that the boys were \u201cmaking the whole thing up,\u201d but he later pleaded no contest to four counts of child abuse, a reduced charge. He was sentenced to four years of probation and his 360-day jail sentence was stayed, the paper reported.\n\nAccording to a police affidavit, Jenkins moved to Whitestown, Ind., after the incident, but he soon came into the crosshairs of law enforcement again. Earlier this month, a deputy with the Winnebago County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who was working with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, created a fake Facebook profile, posing as a 14-year-old girl from Neenah, Wis., named \u201cKylee Marie.\u201d The deputy, who recognized Jenkins from his stint in the Winnebago County Jail, sent the 32-year-old a friend request. Jenkins accepted.\n\nThe two struck up a conversation. Court records filed in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin show \u201cKylee\u201d was candid about her supposed age, asking Jenkins, \u201cdo u care im 14 and drink?\u201d The 32-year-old replied that he didn\u2019t. When the undercover deputy brought up the issue again, typing \u201ci dont drive tho im only 14 lol,\u201d Jenkins allegedly responded, \u201cYa. At your age I was 15 when I got the first DUI,\u201d before asking for a photo of \u201cKylee.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAuthorities say that Jenkins soon began expressing interest in meeting the supposed 14-year-old, telling her, \u201cif i had the money i would put u on a bus.\u201d He allegedly told \u201cKylee\u201d that they could get a house together, and she would be able to drink and party as much as she wanted. She should tell her parents that she was going to spend the next two to three weeks helping out a friend\u2019s parents, he suggested, and would call everyday.\n\n\u201cU would be my kid for ever,\u201d Jenkins wrote, according to the police affidavit. \u201cI have people that would take care of it with the paperwork.\u201d\n\nThe conversation quickly turned sexually explicit, with the 32-year-old requesting nude photographs, police wrote. On Oct. 6, he allegedly asked \u201cKylee\u201d if she would like him to come up to Wisconsin and get her. Not long after the undercover cop playing the part of a teenager agreed, Jenkins said he had started walking. He predicted it would take him two to four days to get to her: 108 hours if he walked, 30 hours if he biked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe decided to walk, police say. The arduous trek would have taken him through the farm country surrounding Indianapolis to the industrial southern shore of Lake Michigan, then through Chicago. Along the way, authorities say, he updated \u201cKylee\u201d on his progress, sending pictures of exit signs and local landmarks such as churches that he passed along the way, and selfies taken during his walk.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear how many of the 300-plus miles Jenkins actually covered on foot. According to court documents, he messaged \u201cKylee\u201d on Thursday, four days after he had started walking, and said he was in Wisconsin. Someone had bought him a bus ticket that got him to Milwaukee, he explained, before telling \u201cKylee\u201d that he wanted to have 500 kids with her, including one in the next year. When Jenkins arrived in Winnebago County later that same day, an FBI agent and local authorities arrested him.\n\n\u201cOur nation faces an epidemic of child sexual abuse, with the Internet making it too easy for predators to communicate with children across the country,\u201d U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger said in a Friday statement.\n\nJenkins faces charges of using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce or entice a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity, which comes with a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and the potential for life in prison. Court records show he has been assigned a federal public defender, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Sunday night.\n\nAD","98":"A South Carolina sheriff candidate is fessing up to something that has tarnished many politicians: sporting blackface.\n\nCraig Stivender, 36, released a campaign ad Tuesday in which he outlines the importance of transparency.\n\n\u201cI want to tell you some things that politicians would try to hide, things that my opponents may try to use to tarnish my integrity,\u201d the Republican candidate said in an television ad that began with aerial shots of the Palmetto State\u2019s waters and woods and with slow-motion shots of Stivender shooting a gun and hugging people.\n\nThe South Carolina native whose family has been in Colleton County for more than 200 years provided more detail about what he meant by that statement.\n\nSitting in a rocking chair and looking directly in the camera, Stivender revealed that he received a ticket as a 16-year-old for not having a driver\u2019s license and that he is married for the second time. He also said he\u2019s lost his temper at work as a police officer and that he was reprimanded for his actions. He even admits to being responsible for some fender benders.\n\nBut the most shocking disclosure was his admission that he wore blackface 10 years ago at a law enforcement Halloween party. The video included an image of Stivender with darkened skin in a turquoise shirt, with studs in his ear and a gold chain around his neck. He was standing next to a black woman.\n\nStivender said he dressed as Demetrius Edward \u201cBig Meech\u201d Flenory, one of the leaders of the Detroit-based Black Mafia Family who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a police officer, the exact opposite would be a gang member,\u201d Stivender said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I picked.\u201d\n\nPoliticians on the left and right of the political spectrum have had to make public apologies for past acts of blackface, a historically racist form of theater in which a nonblack person paints themselves dark as a means to ridicule and mock black people.\n\nEarlier in the year, Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s old medical school yearbook surfaced, showing on Northam\u2019s yearbook page a person in blackface next to another person dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member. He initially took blame and then later said he wasn\u2019t in the photo. Northam, who was elected with great help from black voter turnout, met with black leaders and vowed to complete the rest of his term focused on racial equity.\n\nIn August, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, apologized to her state for a blackface skit she participated in 52 years ago. She has since faced calls for her resignation but has stayed in office.\n\nAcross the northern border, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for multiple images that surfaced last month of him in blackface and brownface. He has admitted that he didn\u2019t know any better at the time the incidents occurred and has moved his talking points to other issues as he faces a reelection campaign.\n\nStivender said he understands the disappointment of those \u201cwho may be upset\u201d but argued that honesty was most important to his nascent campaign.\n\n\u201cThat was a different time,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we understand that type of costume is troubling to many.\u201d\n\nHe told ABC News 4 \u2014 based in Mount Pleasant, S.C. \u2014 that he didn\u2019t know what blackface was 10 years ago and that it wasn\u2019t his intention to offend anyone. He didn\u2019t apologize for his action when reporter Kate Mosso asked if he would.\n\nStivender\u2019s campaign said in an email that it stands behind previous statements and that the campaign has received mostly positive attention from the local community.\n\nThat attention, according to conservative and liberal political strategists, could be a toss-up with voters.\n\nMatt Moore, the state\u2019s former GOP chairman and a partner at political consulting firm First Tuesday Strategies in Columbia, S.C., called Stivender\u2019s ad a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d and said Stivender\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t mean to offend and didn\u2019t know about blackface 10 years ago is a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nMoore noted that had an opponent uncovered Stivender\u2019s past, it probably would have been a one-day story, instead of being the central issue of his campaign.\n\nMoore said the low-country region of South Carolina has a sordid history surrounding race, and Colleton County needs a sheriff who can build bridges and move the community forward.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to understand the context of Colleton County before completely judging the sheriff\u2019s ignorance, said longtime political consultant Wesley Donehue of South Carolina-based Push Digital. His firm has worked with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nDonehue spent part of his childhood in the county. He has never met Stivender, but he did say the sheriff hopeful\u2019s description about the past decade is correct, pointing to the fun that was made of interracial couples in the area and his own grandfather being buried in a Confederate uniform not long ago.\n\n\u201cColleton is really stuck a decade or two behind everybody else,\u201d he said about the county of nearly 38,000. \u201cThe beauty of the Internet is it breaks down the barrier and people in those areas are starting to wise up.\u201d\n\nStill, Donehue believes the county\u2019s black population is owed a personal apology.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running for a top law enforcement position. He has a moral obligation, especially to the minority community, to explain why he did this,\u201d Donehue said, pointing to strained relations between law enforcement and communities of color.\n\nThe county, which once was home to many cotton plantations, is about 60 percent white and 37 percent black, according to census data. Its Latino population is a little over 3 percent. Most of Colleton County voters cast their ballots for President Trump in 2016; he took nearly 53 percent of its votes.\n\nThree Democrats, one of whom is black, and another Republican are also running for Colleton County sheriff.\n\nMoore said the best action for Stivender to take would be to drop out because the state doesn\u2019t need anymore embarrassing sheriffs.\n\nAt least 11 of South Carolina\u2019s sheriffs in its 46 counties have been accused of breaking laws, according to the Post and Courier.\n\n\u201cIf he really didn\u2019t know [about blackface], do voters really want someone who is incapable of Googling to find out,\u201d Moore asked.\n\nRead more:\n\nAlabama\u2019s Republican governor apologizes for wearing blackface in college, refuses to resign\n\nA Belgian festival has long featured a \u2018savage\u2019 in blackface.

There is widespread concern about the possible escape of ISIS prisoners held by Kurdish forces, and on Sunday, it was reported that at least 750 people suspected of affiliation with ISIS fled a secure displacement camp in the chaos caused by Turkish shelling. In addition, several dozen \u201chigh-value\u201d ISIS prisoners were reportedly left behind by U.S. troops when they retreated, the New York Times reported, and ISIS has already claimed at least two attacks in the area since the invasion started, including a car bombing that killed three people.","100":"\u201cThe Queen\u2019s Speech\u201d is designed to acknowledge the 400 years of tradition in the cradle of parliamentary democracy and the ongoing \u2014 although mostly symbolic \u2014 role of the monarch. It is usually a jolly good show, broadcast live, complete with men in wigs bearing ceremonial purses, yeomen in scarlet tunics and lords in robes. There is also a 41-gun salute and a mock search of the Palace of Westminster\u2019s cellars for explosives.\n\nAs for the speech itself? The prime minister and his ministers actually write it. The address lays out the government\u2019s agenda \u2014 even while it remains uncertain how long Johnson\u2019s minority government may last.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd so the queen began her scripted remarks saying her government\u2019s priority \u201chas always been to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 October.\u201d\n\nWhile the debate over Johnson\u2019s domestic agenda begins Monday afternoon at Westminster Palace, all eyes in the chamber will be scrolling the screens of their smartphones for news from Brussels, where British and European negotiators are in their third day of secret talks over the fate of Brexit.\n\nOne of the leaders of the opposition Labour Party, Diane Abbott, panned Monday\u2019s performance, calling it \u201cfarcical.\u201d Another Labour lawmaker, Anna Turley, tweeted after the speech: \u201cAll that pomp and felt like a damp squib. If that\u2019s the summit of the vision of a new Prime Minister who has spent his whole life planning how to get to Downing Street, I\u2019d have hoped for so much more to transform our broken economy, services and society.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, in Brussels, depending upon the hour, reports have been cautiously optimistic or profoundly pessimistic, as negotiators struggle to agree to a deal. The challenge remains what to do about the border on the island of Ireland \u2014 and how to preserve both British sovereignty alongside the E.U.\u2019s demands to protect its single market and customs union.\n\nIn her speech, the queen ticked off 22 new bills comprising Johnson\u2019s domestic proposals. The policy announcements included stiffer penalties for some offenders; an end to \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d for E.U. citizens coming to Britain and efforts to introduce a points-based immigration policy similar to Australia\u2019s; and a new environment bill that will set binding targets on reducing plastic use, cutting air pollution and restoring biodiversity.\n\nJohnson\u2019s attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has dismissed this House of Commons as a \u201czombie\u201d Parliament paralyzed over Brexit: It may go on and on but never dies; it just eats the brains of its captives. A general election looms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe opposition parties say the Johnson government lacks the majority it needs to pass any of the measures outlined in the speech.\n\nSince Johnson became prime minister, his working majority has plummeted from one to minus 43. Johnson lost his reliable votes after 21 Conservative lawmakers \u2014 including Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson \u2014 were kicked out of the party for backing legislation aimed at stopping a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn the three-year-long psychodrama of Brexit, the British press has labeled many weeks \u201cmake-or-break,\u201d with the government facing crunch deadlines.\n\nOn Monday, the Telegraph newspaper called this crunch \u201cthe crunchiest\u201d deadline of all.\n\nAD\n\nThe 28 European leaders will met at the E.U. Council on Thursday and Friday in Brussels. They say this is the last possible opportunity for the heads of the 27 other nations to agree to a Brexit deal \u2014 at least in theory.\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturday, Johnson will face a rare Saturday session of Parliament \u2014 only four times, since Hitler invaded Poland, has the House of Commons convened on a Saturday.\n\nThe lawmakers earlier passed a bill that forbids Johnson from leaving the E.U. this month without a deal. Johnson has repeatedly called it the \u201cSurrender Act.\u201d The prime minister has vowed to leave \u2014 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2014 on Oct. 31.\n\nIf Britain fails to craft a Brexit deal with the Europeans this week, most observers say he will reluctantly find a way to seek an extension \u2014 most likely to stage an election sometime this fall.\n\nAD\n\nIf, however, Johnson cuts a deal, then it will be debated in Parliament on Saturday. Would it, could it pass? Nobody knows. Johnson has lost seven consecutive votes in the House of Commons. The opposition parties have already said they would vote against the deal, whatever it is.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s latest Brexit proposals were first rejected last week in Europe. But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met with Johnson and came away saying they could imagine a landing zone for a deal. Then the E.U. and British specialists went into talks.\n\nIn Brussels, the bureaucrats were mostly gloomy about the chances of a deal; the politicians, however, were less so. The European Union is also famous for crafting deals at five minutes to midnight.\n\nAD\n\nThe stumbling block this week \u2014 as it has been for two years \u2014 is what to do about the border between the Republic of Ireland and the territory of Northern Ireland.\n\nAfter Brexit, Northern Ireland will remain in the United Kingdom, while Ireland will remain part of the E.U. How to control and inspect the flow of people, capital and goods \u2014 especially agricultural products such as meat \u2014 and how to collect customs tariffs between the two entities is the knot that must be untied.\n\nAD\n\nIn his latest overtures, Johnson has proposed that Northern Ireland would essentially remain in the British customs union, but follow E.U. customs rules.\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s in Brussels contributed to this report.","101":"Like an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected \u2014 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \u2014 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s moods flared on Twitter. Five days after the impeachment inquiry began \u2014 on Sunday Sept. 29 \u2014 Trump sent forth a torrent four dozen tweets and retweets, making it at the time the third most prolific day of tweeting of his entire presidency. Over nearly 16 hours on Twitter, he suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) be questioned for \u201cFraud & Treason\u201d and quoted an Evangelical pastor who warned that the impeachment of Trump would \u201ccause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen on Friday, Trump passed that previous milestone with 59 total tweets, including 33 in just 20 minutes. All told, in the week before the launch of the inquiry, Trump averaged 18 tweets per day. In the two weeks following the launch, that doubled: On average, Trump was tweeting three dozen times a day.\n\nHis behavior during a news conference with the Finnish president appeared so erratic to some viewers that a hashtag \u2014 #TrumpMeltdown \u2014 began trending on Twitter. Commentary about the president\u2019s mental fitness ensued.\n\nAD\n\nStaring down impeachment, Trump has seemed to play the role of the nation\u2019s Shakespearean monarch. At a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump boasted about his own fortitude in surviving so many scandals.\n\nRaising his hand and twirling his fingers to point to his right temple, the president mused, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a little different up here. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere is a look at the characteristics Trump has displayed \u2014 and the characters he has inhabited \u2014 since impeachment proceedings began.\n\nMartyr\n\nTrump strode onstage to rapturous applause at a packed arena in Minneapolis Thursday night ostensibly to campaign for reelection in 2020. But he was obsessed instead with the 2016 election, delivering a jeremiad of persecution and self-pity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom Day One, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president cast himself as the ultimate victim of harassment from congressional Democrats, the intelligence community and the media.\n\n\u201cI can do the greatest things in history, and they\u2019ll make them bad to very bad,\u201d Trump decried. \u201cAnd if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it\u2019s like, \u2018Give him the electric chair! That was terrible!\u2019 \u201d\n\nVictimization has long been central to Trump\u2019s political identity, rooting him in the grievance politics of the right and inspiring in his millions of followers a duty to protect the president from any perceived threat. But Trump\u2019s feelings of oppression and persecution have been especially pronounced during the impeachment crisis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Trump tells it, he is the victim of a corrupt, \u201cdeep state\u201d whistleblower who, along with other perceived enemies, has orchestrated a broad conspiracy to claim malfeasance in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 which, in the president\u2019s estimation, was \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201ctotally appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first so-called second hand information \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty,\u201d Trump tweeted last Saturday, deploying his nickname for Schiff.\n\nDriving Trump\u2019s persecution mentality is his undying frustration that his electoral victory in 2016 is undermined by the fact that Russia interfered to boost his candidacy \u2014 and that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.\n\n\u201cI was investigated, okay? Me! Me!\u201d Trump told reporters Oct. 4 at the White House. \u201cIn my campaign \u2014 I ran, I won. I was [investigated]. You won\u2019t say that, will you? I was investigated. I was investigated.\u201d\n\nHeckler\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was another episode of \u201cChopper Talk\u201d \u2014 Trump\u2019s freewheeling question-and-answer sessions with reporters before he boards the Marine One helicopter \u2014 only this time the president was especially agitated. He strode back and forth and sliced the air with his hands.\n\nThen, as Kelly O\u2019Donnell of NBC News asked him to clarify what exactly he was trying to say, Trump gave her The Hand \u2014 five fingers splayed across the lens of her iPhone.\n\nThe gesture was perhaps inadvertent, but the resulting snapshot epitomized Trump\u2019s bullying persona, in which he heckles, belittles and bellows with abandon.\n\nAs has long been his habit, Trump has applied derogatory nicknames to his impeachment antagonists. Schiff is \u201cShifty Schiff,\u201d Pelosi is \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump\u2019s conduct, is \u201cPompous Senator.\u201d\n\nDuring the Oct. 2 news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Trump acted like a schoolyard bulldozer when Jeff Mason of Reuters pressed him repeatedly on a question he did want to answer: What, specifically, Trump sought from Zelensky during a controversial phone call in which he asked him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Trump offered a lengthy digression that failed to answer the question, Mason followed up twice. The second time, Trump was curt.\n\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d he asked.\n\nWhen Mason answered affirmatively, Trump began to badger him, using his perch behind the presidential lectern to order Mason to pose a question to his foreign counterpart.\n\n\u201cDid you hear me? Did you hear me?\u201d Trump angrily admonished Mason, before again urging him to switch topics. \u201cAsk this gentleman a question. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to berate Mason for being part of the \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ccorrupt media.\u201d\n\nThe president never did answer the original question.\n\nAutocrat\n\nIn Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d he is a leader to be obeyed.\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, the president offered that self-assessment in response to criticism of his decision to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria and, in doing so, abandon a longtime critical ally.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nBut the general sentiment also reflected the often defiant posture Trump has adopted while facing impeachment, a \u201cDear Leader\u201d tone more associated with an authoritarian regime than a democracy.\n\nIn defending his call with Zelensky, Trump used a similarly autocratic construction.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThe phrase is one with which the president is comfortable; Trump has asserted he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to do something \u2014 including the absolute right to pardon himself \u2014 over a dozen times since taking office.\n\nProjectionist\n\nAD\n\nIf the Twitterati takeaway of Trump\u2019s news conference with Niinist\u00f6 was that the president was having a #TrumpMeltdown, in Twitter parlance, Trump had a different view of the situation: It was Schiff who was imploding.\n\nAt one point during the East Room event, in response to a question about whether the White House would comply with House subpoenas, Trump accused Schiff of having \u201csome kind of a mental breakdown.\u201d\n\nHe repeated the claim several days later at another White House event, this one ostensibly about the U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement. Referring to previous Schiff comments, in which the Democratic chairman summarized the controversial conversation between Trump and Zelensky using mock dialogue, Trump said Schiff had delivered \u201ca horrible speech\u201d not based in reality, and concluded: \u201cI think he\u2019s having some kind of a breakdown.\u201d\n\nThe tactic is one long-favored by Trump, in which he takes a charge or accusation leveled against him and wields it like a cudgel back on a perceived foe, even in cases where the counterassault may seem hypocritical or preposterous.\n\nNow facing impeachment over a problematic call with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 where he asked Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival as \u201ca favor\u201d \u2014 Trump has rejected the notion that his conversation with Zelensky was anything but \u201cperfect.\u201d Instead, he has accused Biden and his son Hunter of corrupt dealings of their own with Ukraine, despite little evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nFacing the assessment of his own intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping elect Trump, the president has frequently rejected that verdict \u2014 while offering a contradictory theory of his own, supported by no evidence: That Ukraine meddled in the 2016 elections, but with the goal of helping the Democrats.\n\nTrump has even tried to upend impeachment itself, suggesting Pelosi and Schiff should be impeached instead \u2014 never mind that it has been a matter of practice for over two centuries that members of the House and Senate cannot be impeached. He also turned on a member of his own party, Romney, after the Utah senator was critical of him calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201c#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,\u201d Trump wrote, again suggesting his own potential penance be meted out instead to someone with whom he was feuding.\n\nConspiracist\n\nTrump decried the impeachment effort against him as a \u201ccoup.\u201d He accused the intelligence community whistleblower \u2014 as well as the whistleblower\u2019s sources \u2014 of spying on him and committing \u201ctreason.\u201d He described the impeachment process being run by Pelosi and Schiff as \u201ca totally compromised Kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nTo Trump, the impeachment probe is evidence of a plot to remove him from office, part of a dystopian alternate reality he is combating with ominous language and dark proclamations.\n\n\u201cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP,\u201d Trump tweeted on Oct. 1.\n\nSchiff has been a particular target of Trump\u2019s apocalyptic world view. The president has suggested on Twitter no fewer than four times, for instance, that Schiff might be guilty of treason \u2014 a crime still punishable by death.\n\n\u201cArrest for Treason?\u201d Trump wrote in one missive.\n\nHe even brought up the charge while sitting next to the Finnish president, saying of Schiff\u2019s behavior: \u201cAnd some people even say it was treason.\u201d\n\nTrump has spread some of his own conspiracy theories, including that he has been investigated by the Australians, British and Italians, among other foreign governments. He has also suggested that contrary to the assessment of his own intelligence community \u2014 which found that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections in an effort to help him \u2014 it was Ukraine that meddled, hoping to help the Democrats.\n\nPerhaps most ominously, Trump has warned of a civil war. On Sept. 29 \u2014 a day of extreme presidential angst as measured by his near-record output of tweets \u2014 Trump shared with his 65.6 million followers a warning from pastor and televangelist Robert Jeffress from Fox News.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they never will be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nIn moments, Trump seems to understand the peril he faces \u2014 and acknowledges the differing ways he has responded to the impeachment threat engulfing his presidency.\n\n\u201cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable,\u201d he said Monday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. \u201cAnd it\u2019s lucky that I\u2019m the president, because I guess \u2014 I don\u2019t know why \u2014 a lot of people said very few people could handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sort of thrive on it,\u201d he concluded.","102":"The cause was cardiac arrest, said his longtime writing partner, Alfa-Betty Olsen.\n\nA roly-poly comic force with a drooping walrus mustache, Mr. Efron dabbled in the counterculture of 1960s San Francisco before becoming a humorous mainstay of Pacifica\u2019s listener-supported radio stations in Los Angeles and New York.

But it proved expensive to make and, despite drawing acclaim from critics and stars such as John Lennon (\u201cas good as, if not better than, anything that\u2019s on British TV\u201d), it was canceled after two seasons.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Efron\u2019s next major television project was the CBS children\u2019s series \u201cIllustrated, Simplified and Painless Sunday School\u201d (1973-77), an occasionally absurdist retelling of Bible stories. Olsen, who worked as the casting director on Mel Brooks\u2019s film \u201cThe Producers\u201d before writing for Mr. Efron on \u201cDream Machine,\u201d said she created the show after CBS offered the duo a Sunday morning time slot.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s Sunday morning, let\u2019s do Bible stories,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cMarshall really admired this Japanese guy who did \u2018Hamlet\u2019 and played all the parts, so I suggested he do the same.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Efron played every character on the series, including both David and Goliath and the voice of God. At least one episode began with a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer that the show \u201cmay not be suitable for adults;\u201d nonetheless, the dialogue was often laden with Easter eggs for older viewers, including references to Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d and Meredith Willson\u2019s \u201cThe Music Man.\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019ve got trouble, right here in Nineveh City.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nThe series received an award from a Protestant church council, Olsen said, and resulted in a book co-written by her and Mr. Efron: \u201cBible Stories You Can\u2019t Forget, No Matter How Hard You Try.\u201d\n\nMarshall Harold Efron was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 3, 1938. His father was an accountant, his mother a homemaker. \u201cSchool wasn\u2019t much fun for me,\u201d he told the New York Times in 1971, explaining that he was picked on for being short and heavyset. \u201cI started being funny as a kid to avoid being pushed around.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Efron graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles, received a master\u2019s degree in English from the University of California at Berkeley in 1964, and spent one year in law school before turning to acting. He also connected with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and was described in Tom Wolfe\u2019s book on that group, \u201cThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,\u201d as \u201cthe round Mercury of Hip California.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 1967, he moved to New York, where he appeared in Broadway productions of \u201cThe Great White Hope\u201d and \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing.\u201d He was also featured at radio station WBAI, where he hosted a program called \u201cSatirical View\u201d and sometimes filled in for broadcaster Steve Post.\n\nAfter student protesters at Columbia University began occupying buildings on campus in 1968, Mr. Efron and fellow humorist Paul Krassner pretended to be young radicals \u201cliberating\u201d the station\u2019s airwaves. Some listeners apparently failed to recognize the joke.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWithin an hour police arrived at the studios, having received reports of a student takeover and of my detention as a hostage in WBAI\u2019s bathroom,\u201d Post later wrote in a memoir. (Mr. Efron, he added, later called in from a Manhattan telephone booth to play the role of Spiro T. Agnew, the vice president-elect, in an improvised \u201cinterview\u201d in which he announced plans to \u201copen a Cabinet seat for the Department of Astrology.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nMr. Efron\u2019s radio work resulted in an offer to join \u201cDream Machine.\u201d \u201cIf you got high,\u201d executive producer Jack Willis recalled in an interview for WNET, \u201cit was a great show to watch.\u201d\n\nAmong many other sketches, Mr. Efron once explored the intricacies of olive grading, in which olives are variously labeled large, extra large, mammoth, giant, jumbo, colossal and supercolossal. Gargantua olives, he joked, came one per can.\n\nAD\n\nHe also appeared in director George Lucas\u2019s feature film debut, the science-fiction thriller \u201cTHX 1138\u201d (1971), and did voice work for movies including \u201cIce Age: The Meltdown\u201d (2006) and \u201cHorton Hears a Who!\u201d (2008), as well as cartoon series such as \u201cKidd Video,\u201d \u201cThe Biskitts\u201d and \u201cThe Smurfs,\u201d as Sloppy Smurf.\n\nSurvivors include a sister.\n\nOn \u201cDream Machine,\u201d Mr. Efron instructed viewers on the art of writing their own famous last words, which he described as \u201cthe final chance for you to correct the gross impression you\u2019ve been leaving of yourself all over town.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was unclear what words he ultimately selected for himself.

He spent the early days of Taylor\u2019s tenure with Harrisburg gauging how the former everyday major leaguer was handling the demotion. After four or five games, he recognized the 28-year-old\u2019s confidence was shaken.\n\n\u201cYou could sense it,\u201d LeCroy said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a bad attitude, but he didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLeCroy called Jonathan Tosches, the Nationals\u2019 manager of advance scouting, and asked him to put together a highlight video. He wanted to pump Taylor up, show him the player he could be. Maybe this would lead him to return to the hitter he had been at times throughout his career. LeCroy pressed play.\n\nAD\n\nTaylor transformed on the video. He smacked doubles down the lines and in the gaps. He blasted home runs everywhere. He swiped bases with abandon. There he was, in Game 4 of the 2017 National League Division Series, belting a grand slam. The screen went dark. LeCroy handed Taylor a thumb drive.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate them doing that,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey were great at helping me remember [the player I\u2019ve been] and also move forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThree months later, what Taylor puzzled out in Harrisburg proved pivotal. His contributions when called upon, as a surprise pinch hitter and as the center fielder after a right hamstring strain sidelined starter Victor Robles, have played a sizable role in the Nationals\u2019 postseason run. He has still struggled at times with the bat, and his defensive miscue in Game 2 of the NL Championship Series could have ended up being costlier than it was, but he has given the Nationals what they needed. He have the team space to not rush Robles back.\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance the 22-year-old Robles is back this week, maybe as soon as Monday. Taylor will then return to his usual roles of pinch runner and defensive replacement. It would fit in a season of ups and downs, and it would give the Nationals a seasoned bench option to use against the St. Louis Cardinals in a series they lead 2-0.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been unbelievable since he\u2019s come back up,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said of Taylor. \u201cHe understands his role. He\u2019s been really good at it.\u201d\n\nEverything changed in Harrisburg. Taylor worked with Rupp to shorten his swing again and keep the barrel of his bat in the strike zone longer. He continued analyzing pitchers\u2019 pickoff moves to hone the base-stealing approach he might need later. He shagged flyballs and threw to the bases from center and right field before games because General Manager Mike Rizzo wanted him ready if they needed him to replace an injured outfielder or serve as a defensive replacement for the playoffs. (Or, as it turns out, both.)\n\nThe hitting still came slowly. His batting average hovered between .220 and .240, and he still didn\u2019t feel comfortable at the plate. LeCroy remembered a late July game in Portland, Maine, when he thought things might change. Taylor drove a 3-0, \u201creally good fastball\u201d over the fence in center, his third home run in a week. But then he struck out at least once in 15 of the next 16 games, and his batting average sank again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe advantage of major league players playing in the minors is that they don\u2019t worry about stats. Taylor disregarded his numbers, something he looked at in the majors, and searched instead for the rhythm every hitter craves. But by late August, Taylor felt no better. Then, for reasons he still can\u2019t explain, he felt good again two weeks before the Senators\u2019 season ended. He went 3 for 5 one night, collected six more hits in the next three games and polished off the week by going 4 for 4 with four doubles.\n\n\u201cI was finally able to get that feeling,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI just tried to repeat over and over.\u201d\n\nHe executed toward the end of the regular season, when the Nationals sewed up a postseason berth and he played consistently. He sprayed three extra-base hits in his last six at-bats of the regular season. The performance emboldened Martinez to use Taylor \u2014 off the team because of his bat three months earlier \u2014 as a pinch hitter in the biggest moment of the season. Milwaukee Brewers super-reliever Josh Hader plunked Taylor in the eighth inning of the NL wild-card game, a hit by pitch that ultimately sparked the game-winning rally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals needed him later when, in Game 2 of the NLDS, Robles departed in the eighth inning with a mild right hamstring strain. Taylor stepped forward again to replace an injured outfielder and become the Nationals\u2019 starting center fielder.\n\nHe has contributed in myriad ways since, small things such as singling to flip the lineup over the pitcher\u2019s spot in Game 4 of the NLDS. The next inning, Ryan Zimmerman drilled a home run to break the game open. He has done big things, too, such as his difficult, diving catch in center to secure the last out of Game 5 in the NLDS to beat the juggernaut Los Angeles Dodgers. His home run in Game 2 of the NLCS against the Cardinals gave starter Max Scherzer a small early lead on a day when that was all he needed.\n\nThat night, a reporter asked Taylor about his homer. The outfielder misunderstood and thought he meant the line drive that flew by him in the eighth inning. He laughed and explained he couldn\u2019t hear the ball make contact, which made it more difficult to judge. The homer, he added, surprised him. Flyballs hadn\u2019t carried in Busch Stadium until his, when what once looked lost seemed important again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure quite how high it was going to go,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD","104":"Updated January 9, 2017\n\nThis Terms of Sale governs the sale of Washington Post Print Products (the \u201cPrint Products\u201d).\n\n1.

As it turned out \u2014 as it often turns out for Washington \u2014 Rendon did a lot. He scored the Nationals\u2019 first run after doubling in the sixth. He hit the first of back-to-back solo homers off Clayton Kershaw in the eighth as Washington tied the score at 3. Then he revved a 10th-inning rally with a scorched double that stuck in the padding of the left field wall.\n\nAD\n\nEveryone will remember the ending, the Howie Kendrick grand slam, the moment that pushed Washington into an NLCS that it now leads 2-0. But Rendon\u2019s bat made the win possible. He has followed with two hits and three walks against the St. Louis Cardinals. The country is finally seeing a superstar. Ansley just sees a small kid grown up.\n\nHe has, after all, seen Rendon\u2019s swing before. He has seen the muted stance. He has seen Rendon lift his front foot in the middle of the pitcher\u2019s windup, no more than an inch off the ground, before dropping it as if the dirt is an eggshell he can\u2019t break. Rendon learned it all from Ansley, when he was just a 9-year-old in Houston, and he has made only subtle changes since. His hands are a little lower while he waits to hit. His front leg is opened up a bit more this season.\n\nAD\n\nAside from that, details only Ansley and trained hitting coaches can spot, Rendon has stayed the same. The key to the 29-year-old\u2019s offensive success is that he gets ready early. Or, as Nationals hitting coach Kevin Long puts it, \u201cThe thing with Anthony is that he\u2019s never, ever late.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA lot of guys have that big leg kick, they are loading late and trying to time the pitcher, but I could never do that,\u201d Rendon said of his approach. \u201cFor me, it was always really simple: Get your foot up, get it down in the same spot, do it all before the pitcher is releasing the ball, and that way you\u2019re ready for anything. Then all you have to do is hit the ball.\u201d\n\nRendon laughed at that last part. He knows that hitting 98-mph heat, or sharp breaking balls, is so far from easy. He just has a habit of making it look that way. And that\u2019s really the root of what he does at the plate: He\u2019s relaxed. He removes as many variables as possible. He gives himself every opportunity to adjust.\n\nAD\n\nHe often shrugs off questions about his swing or success at the plate, about the 34 home runs, 44 doubles, league-leading 126 RBI and 1.010 on-base-plus-slugging percentage that made him an MVP candidate this season. His swing has made him the heartbeat of the Nationals\u2019 order and, soon, one of baseball\u2019s most sought-after free agents. (Washington offered him a seven-year contract in the range of $210 million to $215 million in early September, but that is not expected to keep Rendon from exploring the market this offseason.) It also has made him one of a few reasons to believe Washington could beat the Cardinals in the NLCS \u2014 just two more wins now \u2014 and advance to the World Series.\n\nAD\n\nRendon, though, would rather explain it all with basic cliches. He says he just does the same thing every time. He says he\u2019s just trying to hit it where the defense isn\u2019t playing. He even suggested recently that his career-best season was largely a product of luck.\n\nBut there is science to the simplicity. It started when Rendon signed up for the Houston Thunder and Ansley became his coach. Ansley, who was in the Houston Astros\u2019 organization in the early 1990s, took interest in how naturally Rendon used his wrists. Most kids didn\u2019t know to snap them while making contact. Rendon did, before any real coaching, and that gave Ansley a good starting point. Ansley had a drill that put a metal pole behind Rendon\u2019s back leg to force him to keep his swing tight. If Rendon didn\u2019t go straight to the ball, he would smack the pole and a loud sound would ring in his ear. It didn\u2019t take long before he was taking cuts as if the pole wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was sort of like playing a video game, even when he was that young,\u201d said Ansley, who still coaches and works for a Houston-area school district. \u201cYou could tell him to do something, and he was so coordinated that he figured it out right away.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe taught Rendon to be a \u201cno-stride\u201d hitter \u2014 the term for lifting your front foot and putting it down in the same spot \u2014 because he didn\u2019t want to complicate hitting. He figured Rendon may add a leg kick or other flares when he got to high school or college, but Rendon never did. He stuck to the understated movement because it made him feel ahead of the pitcher. If his hands and weight are set before the pitch is released, he is ready for high velocity and can react to off-speed. That hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nAnsley remembers one summer tournament, 15 years ago, when he accused a teenage Rendon of trying too hard to blast homers. Rendon hit a bunch of pop flies to the warning track. Rendon denied it, smiling at Ansley, telling him that he wasn\u2019t doing anything differently. But a confession arrived at another showcase the next weekend. Rendon went 14 for 14 across a handful of games on all line-drive singles and doubles. He heard Ansley and, without a word, proved that he could hit however he wanted. Ansley recalled leaning over to another coach and saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll ever get out again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNow that same thought is passed around by Rendon\u2019s coaches and teammates with the Nationals. Rendon is the same human metronome, his knees dipping into a crouch as the pitcher winds up, then his chest-high hands whipping so fast that his swing is a blur. Then he still doesn\u2019t have much to say about it.\n\nAD\n\nThe tweaks are hardly noticeable from year to year. He lowered his hands last season to turn more grounders into line drives. He opened his stance this season, by just a few inches, to add power by giving his hips a chance to make a full turn during each swing. It led to a career high in home runs and his highest slugging percentage. It was evident Wednesday, when he ripped almost every pitch he swung at, when his calmness in big moments pushed the Nationals to a place they\u2019ve never been. And it makes it easy to wonder what Rendon could do next.\n\n\u201cIf everyone was capable, I\u2019d use him as a template for how to hit,\u201d Long said. \u201cBut there\u2019s only one Anthony Rendon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD","107":"Chronic pain is a widespread problem in the United States. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 50 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain; nearly 20 million of those people have high-impact chronic pain , which is persistent and affects a person\u2019s ability to carry out day-to-day activities, resulting in a lower quality of life. Chronic pain is also frequently associated with a higher prevalence of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety.\n\nThough pain is nearly universal \u2014 almost everyone will deal with a bout of serious pain in a lifetime \u2014 chronic pain can be challenging to treat. \u201cWhen you look at the landscape of society, the number-one reason people go to the doctor is because something hurts,\u201d says Yury Khelemsky, an anesthesiologist and associate professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Many of these patients have \u201cunderlying issues that can be corrected,\u201d Khelemsky says. \u201cFor instance, if you have abdominal pain and gallstones, you can take the gallbladder out, and it gets better.\u201d That is called acute pain, and it usually resolves within six months.\n\n[Why icing a sprain doesn\u2019t help, and could slow recovery]\n\nAnother group of people have what Khelemsky calls \u201cvague\u201d pain \u2014 when the source is unclear \u2014 that lasts more than six months. \u201cPerhaps chronic muscle, joint, back or knee pain,\u201d he says. It could be pain that continues after an illness has ended or an injury has healed, or it could involve conditions such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, neuropathy, back problems or irritable bowel syndrome. \u201cAmong this group, with some, we know what it is, and we can kind of fix it; some, we really can\u2019t fix it, or the treatments don\u2019t fix it a good proportion of the time. We see that much more often in our profession,\u201d Khelemsky says. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t a good permanent solution.\u201d\n\nThis is chronic pain, and treating it requires more than the occasional appointment and prescription for medication or therapy. In recognition of that fact, the medical community is turning to other approaches, including increasing patient support and education and improving overall wellness, perhaps with alternative treatments.\n\nIncreased support\n\nOne factor researchers are looking at is continued care outside of office visits. A pilot study published in the Clinical Journal of Pain examined the impact of supportive text messages with guidance and encouragement, such as, \u201cMake plans to spend time with a friend or family member today by phone or video chat,\u201d or, \u201cYou are in control of your health and happiness. Don\u2019t let the small setbacks you experience discourage you.\u201d The researchers found these texts reduced patients\u2019 perception of their pain and decreased the extent to which it hindered their day-to-day life.\n\nA 2019 study of 294 chronic pain patients examined how other out-of-office treatments might improve pain symptoms, as well as mood-related conditions such as depression and anxiety. In the research, the first group of patients were put on a Web-based self-management program with modules about coping with pain, pain medications, communicating with providers, cognitive strategies and more; the patients did regular self-reporting of symptoms and got reminders to complete their modules.\n\nThe second group was treated with the Web-based self-management program, but the patients were also monitored by a nurse who would contact them to add and adjust medications for pain and facilitate mental health referrals for depression and anxiety,\u201d according to study lead researcher Kurt Kroenke, professor of medicine at Indiana University and a research scientist at Regenstrief Institute. \u201cThe nurse had weekly care management meetings with the supervising physician to develop treatment plans for new patients as well as those who were not responding adequately to their current treatment regimens,\u201d he says.\n\nThe results of continued care were promising. \u201cBoth groups had moderate improvement in their pain and mood symptoms, and the improvement was superior what has historically been seen in primary care studies where the control arm simply received \u2018usual primary care,\u2019 \u201d Kroenke says. \u201cThe patient group that additionally received telecare from the nurse-physician team had further improvement beyond that experienced by the group that only received online self-management.\u201d\n\nMore providers and health systems are implementing digital methods of care, such as patient portals, so patients can reach their physicians to communicate progress. Using technology to bolster treatment and educate patients could prove especially helpful for those who have chronic conditions.\n\nKroenke says it\u2019s critical that patients with pain receive more than a single appointment with a doctor during a busy day. \u201cAll single treatments have, on average, modest effects in reducing pain, which means that changing, adjusting or combining treatments is often necessary to optimize outcomes,\u201d he says. That means \u201cfollowing up at regular intervals to monitor and adjust treatment.\u201d\n\nRichard W. Rosenquist, chairman of the department of pain management at the Cleveland Clinic, believes patients with chronic pain benefit from attending organized programs run by a variety of medical specialists to keep up with treatment and self-care options. \u201cWe have a program at Cleveland Clinic called Back on TREK ,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a chronic back pain program with psychologists, physical therapists, spine specialists and other physicians involved. Part of chronic-pain healing is the shared experience; people with back pain find out they\u2019re not alone in the world \u2014 there are other people with the same problem.\u201d\n\nMany of these programs exist across the country for other conditions. For instance, Dan Clauw, director of the Chronic Pain & Fatigue Research Clinic at the University of Michigan, holds regular seminars about living with and managing fibromyalgia.\n\nThere\u2019s promising research that patient education may relieve pain symptoms or improve physical functioning. In a study of people with low-back pain, receiving one-on-one counseling with a physiotherapist increased their ability to do a forward bend and straight leg raise. There\u2019s also evidence that public education on chronic pain, through means such as social media and education classes, can help people avoid risk factors and advocate for family members who are experiencing pain.\n\nBoosting overall wellness\n\nAnother factor in managing and preventing chronic pain is overall wellness. \u201cThe first thing is to stay physically fit and physically active,\u201d Khelemsky says. \u201cIf I could change one thing [it would be that] everyone would eat a proper diet and do some type of physical activity where you\u2019re using your muscles. It\u2019s not just good for the physical body, but it\u2019s good for the emotional state, as well.\u201d\n\nMaintaining a healthy weight can also help long-term, so you are not stressing your joints. \u201cYou have to think of the downstream effect of the pain,\u201d Khelemsky says, noting that people tend to experience more of it as they get older. \u201cIf people set themselves up to deal with pain better, disability and suffering decreases.\u201d\n\nThere are also more doctors and hospitals with integrative programs, such as the Duke University Medical Center, the University of California at San Francisco and Mayo Clinic. This approach considers non-traditional therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, meditation and more as part of a holistic approach to treatment.\n\n\u201cIn our wellness institute, we have an integrative pain program that involves using tai chi, diet changes, therapy and other lifestyle changes,\u201d Rosenquist says. \u201cWe have a Functional Medicine Center led by Dr. Mark Hyman, which focuses on improving access to care, looking at the role of psychology, the diet and exercise in treating chronic pain.\n\n\u201cAll of these contribute to reducing overall levels of pain and are things that are actually important when looking at a long-term view,\u201d Rosenquist says.\u201d If you\u2019re smoking, overweight or sedentary, the likelihood of good long-term outlook goes down. It\u2019s important to talk about the lifestyle change.\u201d\n\nFunctional medicine physicians may look through a different lens than your primary care physician. Yeral Patel, a family medicine physician and integrative specialist in Newport Beach, Calif., says she sees lots of patients for chronic pain syndromes, injury recovery, back and neck pain, and carpal tunnel. \u201cFunctional medicine doctors try to dig deeper and look at the root causes of the pain,\u201d Patel says. \u201cWe try to identify the possible causes of inflammation, such as gut dysfunction, micronutrient deficiency, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers.\n\nAfter taking an extensive history and doing a battery of tests to look at smaller contributing factors that might be preventing recovery, you\u2019ll get an integrative plan \u201cthat utilizes nutrition, exercise and diet, supplements, and mediation for stress management,\u201d Patel says.\n\nShe has also found alternative therapies helpful. \u201cAcupuncture is great to add as an adjunctive therapy and helps release endorphins, the \u2018feel good\u2019 hormones that can help relieve pain and improve a patient\u2019s sense of well-being,\u201d Patel says. \u201cSupplements taken with a physician\u2019s guidance such as turmeric, omega-3, B vitamins, Quercetin and Boswellia are great for decreasing inflammation and alleviating pain.\u201d Always let your doctor know of current regular and pain medications you\u2019re taking before starting supplements, so they can check interactions.\n\nJenna Birch is a journalist, dating coach and author of \u201cThe Love Gap: A Radical Plan to Win in Life and Love.\u201d","108":"Welcome to week four of the impeachment inquiry.

Bush, is very concerned \u2014 and says voters should be, too.\n\n\u201cWhen campaign finance issues are on the front pages of the newspaper every single day, this is a particularly bad time for the FEC not to have a quorum and not be able to respond to enforcement matters, not to be able to have new rulemaking or issue advisory opinions,\u201d she told us.\n\nBut Weintraub isn't going quietly. She won't comment on the specifics of the case against Lev Parnas or Igor Fruman, who also assisted in Rudolph W. Giuliani's shadow agenda on behalf of the president in Ukraine, but she stressed that \u201cthe ban on foreign money, obviously, is needed to make sure we have American elections for Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Russia connection: It remains a mystery where Parnas and Fruman got their money, our colleagues Roz Helderman, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne, and Tom Hamburger report. But \u201cprosecutors alleged that Parnas and Fruman were backed in part by an unnamed Russian national who used them to funnel donations to state and federal candidates.\u201d\n\nIt remains a mystery where Parnas and Fruman got their money, our colleagues Roz Helderman, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne, and Tom Hamburger report. But \u201cprosecutors alleged that Parnas and Fruman were backed in part by an unnamed Russian national who used them to funnel donations to state and federal candidates.\u201d Parnas and Fruman were active GOP donors: \u201cAt least 14 Republican candidates and groups directly received a total of $675,500 in campaign contributions last year \u2026 from the Soviet-born Florida business executives, per the Wall Street Journal's Julie Bykowicz.\n\n\u201cAt least 14 Republican candidates and groups directly received a total of $675,500 in campaign contributions last year \u2026 from the Soviet-born Florida business executives, per the Wall Street Journal's Julie Bykowicz. And six of their donations, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, involved \u201ceither a shell company used to hide the men\u2019s identities or foreign money meant to curry favor with U.S. politicians.\u201d This total includes the $325,000 a pro-Trump super PAC received from the pair's company, Global Energy Producers.\n\nThis total includes the $325,000 a pro-Trump super PAC received from the pair's company, Global Energy Producers. Why this matters: \u201cEvery single one of these contributions is suspect because they were made with an ulterior motive,\u201d Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, told the Journal.\n\nWeintraub slammed the idea of straw donors: \u201cThe ban on contributions in the name of another \u2026 is at the core of the FEC\u2019s mission to ensure that the voters are informed about where the money is coming from and where it\u2019s going and who politicians are indebted to.\u201d\n\nValue in transparency: \u201cIf we have people giving in other people\u2019s names then we lose that valuable information about who is the true source of the money,\u201d she added.\n\nWeintraub also refused to answer whether Trump's calls for governments to investigate Biden actually broke any rules: \u201cI\u2019d rather not answer that question because it\u2019s too close to the facts of an actual thing that could come before the commission in an enforcement context,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she says the laws surrounding foreign national cases are clear: \u201cIt is certainly illegal to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d Weintraub told us. \u201cThat\u2019s just black letter law.\u201d\n\nI will not be silenced.\n\n\n\nThe independence of the United States Federal Election Commission will not be compromised.\n\n\n\n\/1 pic.twitter.com\/T5XfjvQWNw \u2014 Ellen L Weintraub (@EllenLWeintraub) October 10, 2019\n\nThe FEC chair had sharp words for Republicans lawmakers: Last week, the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee requested an ethics investigation into Weintraub. Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) who was named honorary state chair for Trump's reelection campaign earlier this month, accused her of using government time and resources for \u201cideological, and at times political, purposes\u201d \u2014 and to disparage the president.\n\nWeintraub, who originally responded that she would \u201cnot be silenced,\u201d told Power Up: \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable how these supposedly deregulatory advocates suddenly don't like it so much \u2014 free speech isn\u2019t so appealing when they don't like what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nWeintraub warned that the FEC will eventually be back in action \u2014 and no politicians or would-be campaign violators should feel secure in the lull of enforcement power: \u201cThere is a five year statute of limitations so people should not think they can get away with everything,\u201d Weintraub said.\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

(Lefteris Pitarakis\/AP)\n\nGlobal Power\n\nTHE LATEST ON SYRIA: America\u2019s policy for Syria and the region is in upheaval, our colleagues Karen DeYoung, Dan Lamothe, Missy Ryan and Kareem Fahim report.\n\nOver the weekend: Cabinet secretaries denied that Trump's decision to withdraw all 1,000 troops from northern Syria meant the U.S. \"had 'abandoned' its Syrian Kurdish allies to invading Turkish forces and threatened severe sanctions against Ankara.\"\n\nKey quote: \u201cWe obviously could not continue,\u201d a senior administration official told our colleagues, who called the situation \u201ca total s---storm.\u201d\n\nOn the ground: \u201cThis is total chaos,\u201d per the official. Turkey \"gave guarantees\" to the U.S. that its forces would not be harmed, the official said, but noted Syrian militias allied with them \"are running up and down roads, ambushing and attacking vehicles.\" This, per our colleagues, is \"putting American \u00adforces \u2014 as well as civilians \u2014 in danger even as they withdraw. The militias, known as the Free Syrian Army, 'are crazy and not reliable.' At the same time, the official said, the Islamic State is active in the area, and there are reports that Russian and Syrian forces are moving in as well.\"\n\nAnd the Kurds strike a deal: Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. concluded that they could no longer count on U.S. forces and needed to reach a pact with the Iran- and Russia-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe deal that the Syrian Democratic forces made \u201cwill bring forces loyal to Assad back into towns and cities that have been under Kurdish control for seven years,\" our colleagues Liz Sly, Louisa Loveluck, Asser Khattab and Sarah Dadouch write .\n\nBackground: \u201cThe deal followed three days of negotiations brokered by Russia between the Syrian government and the SDF, which had reached the conclusion that it could no longer count on the United States, its chief ally for the past five years in the fight against the Islamic State, according to a Kurdish intelligence official.\"\n\nWhat this means for ISIS: \u201cThe fighting has raised concerns that Islamist militants detained in the battle to defeat ISIS could escape, facilitating the reconstitution of the Islamic State,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Ben Hubbard, Charlie Savage, Eric Schmitt and Patrick Kingsley report. \u201cAs American troops were redeployed, two American officials said the United States had failed to transfer five dozen 'high value' Islamic State detainees out of the country,\u201d per the Times.\n\nWe don't know how many escaped: \u201cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped,\u201d our colleagues Karen, Dan, Missy and Kareem report. The Times cites U.S. officials as saying that the Kurds refused to let the retreating U.S. forces take any more ISIS detainees from their makeshift prisons.\n\n\u201cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped,\u201d our colleagues Karen, Dan, Missy and Kareem report.

But it's too early to tell whether ISIS will be resurgent, according to The Times. \u201cThe likelihood ... remains hard to gauge, since the Syrian Kurdish leadership may have exaggerated some incidents to catch the West\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nA US soldier sits atop an armored vehicle during a demonstration by Syrian Kurds earlier this month.

He added that \u201cfor me \u2014 as a guy that served in the military and really got into politics because I believe in the role America plays \u2014 to see this yet again, you know, leaving an ally behind \u2026 is disheartening, depressing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear the president and people like Rand Paul talk about endless wars all the time, and it\u2019s kitschy.

Lee and Kristen Welker reported last week.\n\nA Giuliani associate is also expected to testify: Semyon \u201cSam\u201d Kislin, a Ukrainian-born businessman, is also scheduled to be deposed by lawmakers. BuzzFeed's Michael Sallah, Tanya Kozyreva and Aubrey Belford reported. Kislin served on a business advisory council for then-Mayor Giuliani.\n\nLater this week: Sondland will testify it was Trump who told him there was no \"quid pro quo.\" Sondland \"intends to tell Congress this week that the content of a text message he wrote denying a quid pro quo with Ukraine was relayed to him directly by [Trump] in a phone call, according to a person familiar with his testimony,\" our colleagues Aaron C. Davis and John Hudson scooped over the weekend.\n\nSondland will tell House investigators Thursday he doesn't know if Trump was telling the truth: \"It\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters. \"The call lasted less than five minutes, and Trump appeared to be in a foul mood, according to the person, who spoke to The Post with Sondland\u2019s permission, an intermediary said,\" our colleagues write.\n\nThe ambassador will also offer an alternative theory: A scenario where Trump ditches the scheme amid mounting pressure to release the $400 million in security assistance.\n\nAnd Adam Schiff indicates the whistleblower may not testify at all: The House Intelligence Committee chairman said \"that protecting the identity of the whistleblower who raised the alarm about President Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine is 'our primary interest,' in a sign that House Democrats may not press the individual to testify before Congress,\" our colleague Felicia reports.\n\nIn the Media\n\nVIDEO OF FAKE JOURNALIST SHOOTING SHOWN AT TRUMP RESORT: \"A video depicting a macabre scene of a fake President Trump shooting, stabbing and brutally assaulting members of the news media and his political opponents was shown at a conference for his supporters at his Miami resort last week, according to footage obtained by The New York Times,\" the Times's Michael S.

We\u2019ve added a new category of claims, Ukraine probe, and in just a few weeks it has topped 250 entries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, Trump earned his fastest Bottomless Pinocchio ever with his repeated false statement that the whistleblower compliant about the call was inaccurate. The report accurately captured the content of Trump\u2019s call and many other details have been confirmed, yet Trump has repeated this Four Pinocchio claim 29 times. (It takes 20 repeats of a Three or Four Pinocchio claim to merit a Bottomless Pinocchio, and there are now 27 entries.)\n\nAnother false claim \u2014 that Biden forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he was investigating his son Hunter \u2014 just barely missed the cutoff for inclusion. (Trump has said it 18 times.) We presume the falsehood will earn a spot on the Bottomless Pinocchio page in the next update.\n\nTrump crossed the 10,000 mark on April 26. From the start of his presidency, he has averaged nearly 14 such claims a day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlmost one-fifth of these claims are about immigration, his signature issue \u2014 a percentage that has grown since the government shut down over funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In fact, his most repeated claim \u2014 218 times \u2014 is that his border wall is being built. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so he has tried to pitch bollard fencing and repairs of existing barriers as \u201ca wall.\u201d\n\nFalse or misleading claims about trade, the economy and the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign each account for about 10 percent of the total. Claims on those subjects are also among his most repeated.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed 204 times that the U.S. economy today is the best in history. He began making this claim in June 2018, and it quickly became one of his favorites. The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton \u2014 or Ulysses S. Grant. Moreover, the economy is beginning to hit the head winds caused by Trump\u2019s trade wars, with the manufacturing sector in an apparent recession.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn 171 occasions, he has claimed the United States has \u201clost\u201d money on trade deficits. This reflects a basic misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.\n\nTrump has falsely said 171 times that he passed the biggest tax cut in history. Even before his tax cut was crafted, he promised it would be the biggest in U.S. history \u2014 bigger than Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1981. Reagan\u2019s tax cut amounted to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and none of the proposals under consideration came close to that level. Yet Trump persisted in this fiction even when the tax cut was eventually crafted to be the equivalent of 0.9 percent of GDP, making it the eighth-largest tax cut in 100 years. This continues to be an all-purpose applause line at the president\u2019s rallies.\n\nThe president\u2019s constant Twitter barrage also adds to his totals. Nearly 20 percent of the false and misleading statements stemmed from his itchy Twitter finger.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker database has recorded more than 350 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times.\n\nEven as Trump\u2019s fact-free statements proliferate, there is evidence that his approach is failing.\n\nFewer than 3 in 10 Americans believe many of his most-common false statements, according to a Washington Post Fact Checker poll published in December. Only among a pool of strong Trump approvers \u2014 about 1 in 6 adults in the survey \u2014 did large majorities accept several, although not all, of his falsehoods as true.\n\nThe award-winning database website, created by graphics reporter Leslie Shapiro, has an extremely fast search engine that will quickly locate suspect statements the president has made. We encourage readers to explore it in detail. We recently added a new feature that provides a URL for every claim that is fact-checked, allowing readers to post the link on social media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNote: The Fact Checker welcomes academic research of the Trump claims database.

The 80-year-old artist\u2019s latest exhibition features nearly 40 works of glass and porcelain, plus two larger bronze sculptures, focusing on the meaning of death as well as the artist\u2019s own mortality. Through Jan. 20. Free-$10.\n\n[Judy Chicago contemplates death, and all it means, in this powerful exhibition]\n\n\u2018Stop Making Sense\u2019 at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: This year marks the 35th anniversary of one of the best concert films of all time. Director Jonathan Demme captured a Talking Heads concert in Los Angeles, and while the performance alone is electrifying enough to make it worth watching, it\u2019s the visual orchestration of the deconstruction of a concert and its reconstruction (yes, singer David Byrne\u2019s big suit included) that should draw you to the Hirshhorn on Monday for a free midday screening. 3 p.m. Free.\n\nRoyal Knights: \u2018Clue\u2019 Edition at the Royal: The latest in the Royal\u2019s one-off cocktail parties is a tribute to everyone\u2019s favorite mystery board game \u2014 or everyone\u2019s favorite cult-classic multi-ending murder mystery. Lauren Paylor of Petworth\u2019s hot Dos Mamis is the special guest, joining house bartenders Jake Kenny and Alonzo Freeman to craft six drinks named after \u201cClue\u201d suspects, such as Mr. Green With the Revolver (smoked vodka, white rum, gunpowder tea tincture, salted cucumber syrup and lemon). All cocktails are $8, while canned Atlas beers are $3.

There are more than 100 permutations of how this show by MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d recipient Branden Jacobs-Jenkins could theoretically be cast among a small crew of actors. That\u2019s not the only playful riff in this modern adaptation of the 15th-century morality play \u201cEveryman,\u201d which still grapples with the original version\u2019s questions of life, death and fate. Through Nov. 17. $49-$120.\n\nWilco at the Anthem: Most bands can only dream of having as prolific and influential a catalogue as Wilco. The Chicago-based sextet stormed out of the gate with a run of albums that concluded with 2001\u2019s defining, experimental \u201cYankee Hotel Foxtrot,\u201d but since then, the alt-rockers have been siloed by playing engaging but safe music that you wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear your dad blasting on a road trip. And you certainly wouldn\u2019t expect after 25 years for the band to deliver one of its sharpest works yet with \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d The group\u2019s 11th album is a self-meditation on the harmonious folk elements that keep Wilco going and longtime fans coming back, but also revitalizes it in a way that will draw in new listeners and skeptics alike. 7:30 p.m. Sold out.\n\nTakacs Quartet at the Kennedy Center: As bodies shed and replace their cells, long-standing musical ensembles evolve through different members over the years. The Takacs Quartet was founded in 1975 by four students at the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest; today, there is only one Hungarian left. Yet like bodies, ensembles retain a particular thumbprint that makes them unique even as the cells renew. The Takacs Quartet (pronounced TA-katch) has retained an immediate, vital, almost informal air: enthusiastic communicators rather than ascetic purists, with a Central European warmth to their sound as their instruments converse with one another.

Check out the Lime Amaro Sour, which has been aged in a Cotton & Reed amaro\/Negroni barrel to add some funk, or if you\u2019re looking for something heavier, order the Swampoodle, an Irish oatmeal imperial stout that has been sitting in a District Distilling whiskey barrel and will be served on a nitro tap to add extra creaminess. 6 to 11 p.m. No cover charge.\n\n[What you\u2019ll find at Red Bear, the new brewery bringing the Pacific Northwest to NoMa]\n\nLakota Music Project at Washington National Cathedral: Musicians from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra make beautiful music together as the Lakota Music Project, a collaboration that showcases native music, nonnative music and new commissions.

The 26-year-old has shared a wealth of fuzzy rock tracks through different media, but they are all defined by his knack for concise melodies that have a tendency to loop in your head and his skillful guitar stylings. \u201cHouse of Sugar,\u201d from the musician born Alexander Giannascoli, might offer the most vivid and inviting entry point yet into the world of (Sandy) Alex G. Some of the songs are intentionally a little muddled to add mystery, but Giannascoli\u2019s instrumentation and voice have never come through clearer to paint a portrait of one of the decade\u2019s defining indie rock artists. 7:30 p.m. $20-$25.\n\nMiddleburg Film Festival at various locations: Washington cinephiles have no shortage of film festivals, with a busy annual schedule that includes FilmFest DC, AFI Docs, DC Shorts, the Washington Jewish Film Festival, the Environmental Film Festival and the March on Washington Film Festival competing for attention. Yet the seven-year-old Middleburg Film Festival, held in a quiet horse-country town that doesn\u2019t have a dedicated movie theater, has become an important stop on the national festival circuit: Emma Stone introduced a screening of \u201cLa La Land\u201d in 2016, and Viggo Mortensen and Peter Farrelly hosted a Q&A last year after \u201cGreen Book\u201d won the Audience Award.

It\u2019s time to shoot pumpkins, sip cider and tour area farms.]\n\nPharoahe Monch at the Kennedy Center: Having a seemingly endless amount of music to listen to with just a few taps is certainly nice and all, but anyone looking for the debut solo album of Pharoahe Monch, one of the finest underground rappers of the 1990s, has been out of luck. \u201cInternal Affairs\u201d has long been a rarity in the physical or streaming realm because of the booming single \u201cSimon Says,\u201d which was the subject of legal battles because of its sampling of music from the Godzilla movies. Starting Oct. 18, in celebration of the album\u2019s 20th anniversary, fans and record collectors will be able to get their hands on Monch\u2019s fiery opus. D.C. rapheads will get a bonus when the 46-year-old emcee comes to the Kennedy Center to talk about the making of \u201cInternal Affairs\u201d on Wednesday (7 p.m., $15) followed by a front-to-back performance of the album on Thursday. 7:30 p.m. $35.\n\nChurchKey\u2019s 10th Anniversary Celebration, featuring Allagash: No bar has been as important to the craft beer movement over the past decade as ChurchKey. Its long, ambitious beer menus and star-studded tap takeovers have played a part in landing ChurchKey on numerous \u201cBest American Beer Bars\u201d lists, but it\u2019s also the not-so-obvious things \u2014 temperature controls for different beer styles, intensive staff training, the use of proper glassware \u2014 that keep ChurchKey at the top of its game. Hike up those worn metal stairs again on Thursday as ChurchKey continues its 10th anniversary celebrations with a special event featuring Allagash owner Rob Todd and Allagash brewer Jason Perkins, who are bringing 40 of their Belgian-style ales. Of particular note is the Cloister, a special blend of Allagash White, wild-fermented coolship beer and a wood-aged saison created just for ChurchKey. 4 p.m. Free; beers priced individually.\n\nRosslyn Cider Fest at Gateway Park: It\u2019s hard cider season in the Mid-Atlantic, with cideries hosting festivals nearly every weekend.

Defiance. (The Irish pub staple Strongbow will also be served.) Admission is free, but $15 gets 10 tickets for cider tastings. Beyond drinks, there will be food trucks, including Swizzler and Mama\u2019s Donut Bites, and live music from Justin Trawick and the Common Good. 4 to 8 p.m. Free; cider tasting $15.\n\nFriday, Oct. 18\n\n29Rooms at D.C. Armory: The creators of the digital media juggernaut Refinery29 have concocted a pop-up exhibition that makes you feel as if you\u2019re stepping inside the mind of an artist, \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d-style. Each of 29Rooms\u2019 imaginative installations offer widely different interactive and visual experiences. There\u2019s \u201cThe Art Park,\u201d composed of playful designs from five regional and national artists (including D.C.\u2019s Trap Bob) and an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d-esque installation called \u201cDream Doorways\u201d from R&B\/pop star and Alexandria native Kali Uchis. Sprinkled into the art menagerie is a \u201cDance Break\u201d room and a space called \u201c29 Questions,\u201d where brave visitors are encouraged to sit and chat up a stranger. Through Oct. 27. $10-$34.\n\nBoo at the Zoo at the National Zoo: The popular Halloween destination for kids and families to get their candy and exotic animal fix opens this weekend. A ticket gets you a trick-or-treat bag, after-hours access to various animal exhibits and the chance to participate in activities such as a dance party and children\u2019s karaoke. While the giant panda exhibit won\u2019t be open for costumed visitors, the consolation prize will be a chance to meet \u201cCount Pandula.\u201d Through Sunday. 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. $30 (Saturday is sold out).\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 Live: The Great Cheesy Movie Circus Tour at National Theatre: Joel Hodgson is donning the red jumpsuit for the last time. He started playing Joel Robinson in 1988, \u201cjust another face\u201d \u2014 per the old \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000\u201d theme song \u2014 who did a good job cleaning up the place, but his bosses didn\u2019t like him, so they shot him into space. In space, a.k.a. cable television, Hodgson survived a barrage of cheesy movies by \u201criffing\u201d on them mercilessly with two robot friends, and a new art form was born. This weekend, Hodgson, 59, will sport the red jumpsuit for the first time since 1993 and bring a live version of the MST3K format familiar to fans: making fun of bad movies \u2014 in this case, the British schlockfest \u201cCircus of Horrors\u201d (1960) and the 1986 kung fu flick \u201cNo Retreat, No Surrender\u201d \u2014 interspersed with sketches.

Banerjee and Duflo, later performed similar studies, building research methods that \u201cnow entirely dominate\u201d development economics, according to the Nobel committee.\n\nThose efforts helped inspire school tutoring programs that have benefited more than 5 million Indian children, for instance, as well as preventive health-care subsidies in a number of countries, the committee said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn just two decades their new experiment-based approach has transformed development economics, which is now a flourishing field of research,\u201d the Nobel Prize committee said on Twitter. Later, in a news release, the panel noted that, \u201cDue to their work, field experiments have become development economists\u2019 standard method when investigating the effects of measures to alleviate poverty.\u201d\n\nThe three laureates were among the first to attempt to measure the real-world effects of poverty-alleviation efforts in a wide array of areas, including access to credit, preventive health care and the adoption of new technologies.\n\nThe researchers also found that even small differences in prices can lead to dramatically different health outcomes, particularly in preventive care. Kremer, for instance, discovered that 75 percent of poor parents would give their children deworming pills for parasitic infections when the medication was free, compared with 18 percent when the medicine cost less than $1, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter these findings, the committee said, the World Health Organization recommended that medicine be distributed free to more than 800 million schoolchildren in areas where more than 20 percent have a certain kind of parasitic worm infection.\n\nSimilar efforts by the researchers have suggested that clear incentives and accountability for teachers could reduce absenteeism, finding that \u201cpupils who had teachers on short-term contracts had significantly better test results,\u201d according to a news release by the committee.\n\nThe researchers also conducted an \u201cinitial\u201d study on microcredit programs, or the giving of small loans, to poor households in the Indian city of Hyderabad. Additionally, the panel cited their work in showing that some poor individuals were more likely to adopt temporary subsidies \u2014 for agriculture improvements such as artificial fertilizer \u2014 rather than if they are permanently on offer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked by a reporter what she would do with the winnings, Duflo said she as a child read about how the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, Marie Curie, used her money to buy a gram of the element radium.\n\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll talk between the three of us and figure out what is our gram of radium,\u201d Duflo said.\n\nDuflo and Banerjee are married, making them at least the sixth such partners to collect Nobel Prizes. Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, shared the 1903 prize in physics (She won again in 1911, for chemistry). Their daughter, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, and her husband, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliet, were awarded the chemistry prize in 1935.\n\nAD","115":"\u201cAs you can see, my tweets are pretty passionate,\u201d Spanbauer, who uses a different name online, said in an interview, adding that she doesn\u2019t specifically wish anyone physical harm. \u201cIt hits very close to home for me. What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \u2014 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that now threatens Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nAD\n\nThe chain reaction represents a new test of the power of weaponized language to inspire physical violence. Over the summer, Trump faced criticism for employing anti-immigrant rhetoric that was parroted by the man accused of fatally shooting22 people at a Walmart in El Paso in August. In the fall of 2018, an avid Trump supporter mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats.\n\nWhat many of the violent, anti-Schiff messages have in common is the inspiration they appear to draw from the president\u2019s words, or from the words of his associates and allies in Congress and conservative media.\n\nAD\n\nA tweet from Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, arguing that Schiff should be \u201csuspended\u201d was reposted by a user with nearly 50,000 followers who envisioned the congressman\u2019s public hanging in a football stadium. The post remained live as of Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nA tweet from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) describing Schiff as a \u201cproven liar\u201d who should be \u201cheld accountable\u201d was reposted by a user with thousands of followers and a longing for the \u201cgood old days when traitors like Schiff would be hanged by the neck until dead.\u201d It also remained live.\n\nA tweet from Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, was reposted by a user with only a small following who envisioned Schiff sitting in front of a firing squad. The post was taken down.\n\nAD\n\nNeither Giuliani nor Schlapp responded to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond. But a spokeswoman for Scalise defended his rhetoric, saying the Louisiana congressman \u2014 among the victims of a shooting at congressional baseball practice in 2017 \u2014 knows firsthand the consequences of extreme language.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs someone who was targeted by a leftist motivated by violent rhetoric towards Republicans, Whip Scalise is well aware of the dangers of that kind of rhetoric,\u201d said Lauren Fine, the spokeswoman. \u201cAdam Schiff has a detailed history of using irresponsible, false and accusatory rhetoric throughout Trump\u2019s presidency, which is what this tweet simply documents in Schiff\u2019s own words.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Schiff said the security of the congressman and his staff is \u201calways a top priority,\u201d declining to go into more detail about specific threats. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police said authorities consult with individual congressional offices on \u201csecurity-related matters\u201d but declined to discuss precautions around the high-stakes impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nThe most graphic and specific threats against Schiff were quickly scrubbed from Twitter, whose policies prohibit threats of violence as well as the \u201cglorification of violence.\u201d At least one additional tweet was removed after it was flagged for the company by The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nBut much of the vitriol remained. And the violent language also reached beyond Twitter, echoing on platforms such as Facebook and 4chan, a sprawling online agora where hate speech and violent threats are routine. A link to an article about Trump\u2019s accusation of treason against Schiff appearing on a Facebook page called \u201cUSA Patriots for Donald Trump,\u201d which boasts nearly 2 million followers, drew a slew of comments about the congressman being hanged.\n\nThe heightened focus on Schiff reflects the extent to which the former prosecutor and longtime Los Angeles-area congressman has become the b\u00eate noire of the Trump movement since becoming the de facto head of the investigation of Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist Ukraine\u2019s help in damaging former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. Schiff has come under criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans as they seek to delegitimize the inquiry by portraying it as tainted by political bias. The nub of the criticism of Schiff is that he spoofed the president\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart during a congressional hearing and that he made misleading statements about the nature of his prior knowledge of the initial whistleblower complaint.\n\nAD\n\nAnalysts say the pattern resulting in the violent rhetoric targeting Schiff makes evident the radicalizing effect of social media, which Trump uses to incite his followers against his perceived enemies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhole online communities are forming around these sentiments, like MAGA,\u201d said Amarnath Amarasingam, an expert on political violence and an assistant professor at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, referring to Trump\u2019s campaign slogan. \u201cThe online social movement of Trump supporters is very real, and a cohort of that movement has come out and said they\u2019re ready to take up arms when needed. This is something a few of us have been worried about for some time.\u201d\n\nThe web is where the president\u2019s hold over his supporters comes into sharpest focus, the extremism researcher said. On Twitter, his opinions \u2014 and his disparaging views of other politicians \u2014 are received uncritically, Amarasingam added, giving Trump enormous power over his followers and \u201csetting the stage for violence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome Trump critics have also used sharp language online, including accusing the president of treason and noting the maximum penalty: death.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death,\u201d former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, said last month on MSNBC of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. The comment was tweeted by a reporter, and retweeted by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.).\n\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz,), who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in 2011, said the responsibility of politicians to \u201cseek the truth\u201d and \u201ctreat their fellow Americans with respect\u201d was heightened \u201cin charged times.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGlobally, public figures are not living up to that responsibility, said Jacob Davey, senior research manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a U.K.-based think tank dedicated to countering extremism and polarization. The result is increasing online radicalization \u2014 not just in the Middle East and Northern Africa, long the focus of extremism research, but also in the heart of the West.\n\nAD\n\nSocial media, he said, \u201chas undoubtedly made engaging in such behavior easier than ever before, with users escaping the legal and social repercussions of their actions.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to craft an alternate universe for his supporters, in which he is the victim of lawless Democrats, rests on an unregulated online ecosystem, where fake news travels faster than the truth.\n\nAD\n\nSpanbauer, who became dissatisfied with Obama during his first term and voted for his Republican challenger in 2012, said she gets most of her news on Twitter and YouTube. Among those she trusts are Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity (\u201cof course\u201d) and Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch (\u201cthank God for Tom Fitton\u201d).\n\nTrump, she said, channels her anger at Washington, while speaking directly to his supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, really, what Trump does on Twitter,\u201d said Spanbauer, who has worked in retail and sales and struggles, along with her husband, to stay above the federal poverty line.\n\nAD\n\nBeneath her verdict on Schiff\u2019s fate, which she acknowledges was hyperbolic, lies a firm conviction that the congressman is guilty of treason.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, she said, is a \u201csupreme insult to our country.\u201d Those leading it \u201cshould be held accountable to the length of the law,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s treason. It\u2019s treason.\u201d","116":"We have no idea if the anonymous op-ed writer is still employed, but over the past year, we have seen just how flawed was his or her thinking and how deluded was the decision of hundreds of political appointees to remain in place.\n\nLet\u2019s say you are at the State Department. Over the past year, you have seen Trump (backed up fully by his most loyal flunky, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) abandon the Kurds, ceding domination of the region to Syria, Turkey and Russia. We saw Trump repeatedly invite foreign countries to intervene in our elections and delay aid to Ukraine (with the Russian bear breathing down its neck) to achieve his political aims. Trump, with Pompeo\u2019s assistance, has accorded North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un unprecedented legitimacy and now ignores missile tests. Trump allowed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to escape any accountability for his involvement in the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and refuses to cut off support for the Saudis\u2019 genocidal war in Yemen. Pompeo refused to protect superb career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch, our ambassador to Ukraine, from a political hit job.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow, then, has a political appointee in the State Department protected America?

Trump has gotten worse on your watch.\n\nThe same is true of each and every department and agency in the Trump administration. At the Justice Department, lawyers have been asked to misrepresent the real reason for adding the citizenship question to the census, ignore impeachable conduct by the president in soliciting foreign intervention in our election and support an attorney general traveling the globe to prove a crackpot theory about the 2016 election that would undermine the findings of the intelligence community (including the FBI) and take ludicrous positions in a variety of cases (e.g. eradicating the Affordable Care Act, allowing the president to snatch funds to pay for the wall in contravention of Congress). Remaining at the Justice Department means you will risk your integrity and law license to cater to the whims of an unmoored president and an attorney general who acts like the president\u2019s lawyer, not the country\u2019s.\n\nIn sum, the delusion of \u201cpreventing even worse things\u201d or \u201ckeeping the trains running\u201d needs to end.

Mnuchin said the White House hopes that a formal agreement can be codified during a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Chile next month.\n\nThe cautious tone from China, echoed in other official channels, reflected Beijing\u2019s wariness of Trump\u2019s willingness to stick to any agreement.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese don\u2019t trust the Americans to honor this mini-deal,\u201d analysts at Trivium\/China, an economics consultancy, wrote in a note Monday night. \u201cSo they don\u2019t want to tout its importance just to have it blow up in their face.\u201d\n\nBut the impetus for Beijing to continue with trade talks was underlined Monday by official statistics showing the pressures on its external sector.\n\n\n\nWomen shop at the Shanghai Disney flagship store at the Hongqiao Railway Station in Shanghai on Oct. 14.

Over the course of this year, Chinese imports of American goods have decreased by 26.4 percent, while exports to the United States are down 10.7 percent.\n\nLi Kuiwen, a spokesman for the customs department, said the external environment is \u201ccomplicated and severe\u201d and that instability and uncertainty are increasing.\n\nHowever, he tried to play down the effect of the trade war on China\u2019s economy. While frictions with the United States \u201chave caused considerable pressure on China\u2019s foreign trade,\u201d Li told reporters in Beijing on Monday, China\u2019s overall trade volume in the first three quarters of this year continued to grow.\n\n\u201cThe world remains highly optimistic about China\u2019s market potential,\u201d he said.\n\n[Chinese state TV cancels broadcasts of NBA preseason games and sponsors drop out in dispute over Hong Kong comments ]\n\nLi, echoing sentiments in the state media and from other government departments, emphasized the \u201cprogress\u201d in the trade talks and the plans for continued consultations. \u201cAs for where this is going next, we have been keeping a close watch alongside relevant authorities.\u201d\n\nAt the Foreign Ministry, spokesman Geng Shuang described \u201csubstantive progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey discussed follow-up arrangements and agreed to work toward the direction of reaching a final agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope the U.S. will work with China and meet each other half way and follow the principles and directions set by our leaders and on the basis of equality and mutual respect, properly solving each other\u2019s concerns and ensuring the steady progress of bilateral economic and trade relations.\u201d\n\nAfter talks in Washington last week, Trump said that the United States and China had reached a \u201csubstantial phase one\u201d pact.

Former senator and secretary of state William Cohen gave it to her sister, Robbie McCauley, after a shooting at the Holocaust Museum. (John Kelly\/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nThis summer, Anita Henderson, a retired District schoolteacher, was going through her Silver Spring basement with an eye toward downsizing. Hanging in a closet was something she hadn\u2019t thought about for a while but something she didn\u2019t want anyone to forget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a Windbreaker-type jacket,\u201d Henderson told me. \u201cWhen I saw it, I said, \u2018My goodness. That\u2019s Mr. Cohen\u2019s jacket.\u2019 And everything just started coming back.\u201d\n\nThis is the story of that jacket and how it ended up on the shoulders of Henderson\u2019s sister, Robbie McCauley , a performer, playwright and retired Emerson College professor who lives in Boston. In 2009, McCauley was in Washington to direct \u201cAnne and Emmett,\u201d a play written by Janet Langhart Cohen , who is married to William Cohen, the former U.S. senator and secretary of defense.\n\n\u201cAnne and Emmett\u201d is about an imagined meeting between Anne Frank and Emmett Till. It was to have its premiere at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on June 10, 2009. That afternoon, as Langhart Cohen was being driven to the museum, a gunman burst in, killing security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns.\n\nWilliam Cohen: \u201cFive or six shots were fired right away. . . . [Afterward], everybody had been evacuated from the building except me and the actors and Robbie. None of us could leave. I had to give a statement to what I had seen.\u201d\n\nCohen, McCauley and others were ushered by security personnel to the back of the museum.\n\nRobbie McCauley: \u201cIn fact, it was Senator Cohen who said, \u2018Go that way.\u2019 And he very quickly explained to me what had happened. He himself had been coming down the [entrance] steps while the shooting was happening.\n\n\u201cI remember being really panicked and breathing hard. . . . I remember Senator Cohen saying to me, \u2018Just calm down.\u2019 I was shaking. I think it was air-conditioned, and I was shaking. And he gave me his jacket.\u201d\n\nThe black jacket was a men\u2019s XL. Embroidered on the front were the words \u201cHead. Intelligence.\u201d\n\nCohen: \u201cFor a number of years I served on the board of Head Sports. One of their [tennis] rackets was called the Intelligence. . . . I had forgotten all about that.\u201d\n\nAnita Henderson: \u201cWhen she came home after the incident, apparently she just put the jacket down. Then it got in my basement closet.\u201d\n\nMcCauley: \u201cI didn\u2019t find out until later who the guard who was shot was. And I remembered him, because he was such a nice man.\u201d\n\nJanet Langhart Cohen: \u201cHow ironic, how sad, that here we are in the 21st century, thinking that all of that hatred, racism and anti-Semitism are behind us, or at least underground, but here a neo-Nazi gets out of his car at a Jewish shrine, and he kills a black man.\u201d\n\nMcCauley: \u201cRight now things are just shockingly surprising in terms of the public discourse and public events around these issues. I\u2019m hoping that this is just revealing something that has always been there and that, now it\u2019s more public, we can begin to change for the better.\u201d\n\nLanghart Cohen: \u201cYou think that these racist and anti-Semitic notions will die out. We look to the young and think, \u2018Well, the old ones will die, and new ones will come.\u2019 Then you remember Dylann Roof and what happened at the border in El Paso recently. Young people have had this hate passed on to them.\u201d\n\nCohen: \u201cJust a few months ago, we were going to Baltimore to see a new production at Morgan State University and a pop-up came up on our phones saying there had been another [synagogue] shooting. It was actually six months to the day that a shooting had taken place [at a synagogue] in Pennsylvania. This one was out in California.\u201d\n\nLanghart Cohen: \u201cSadly, that day, it\u2019s timeless in a way. Racism and anti-Semitism are the gifts that keep on giving. You talk about that happening then, compared to where we are now, and it seems like the now and then have always been. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I wrote the play \u2018Anne and Emmett.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHenderson: \u201cThere was a lot of news around the [Holocaust Museum] incident. Some of it is beginning to fade with time. . . .

The omission is the latest twist in an ongoing debate about how much researchers ought to disclose to the public about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn April, Johnston announced that the Agriculture and Life Sciences (AgriLife) program at Texas A&M would join the NutriRECS consortium and provide \u201cgenerous support\u201d to NutriRECS. AgriLife includes a beef cattle teaching program, educational workshops for cattle ranchers and promotion of Texas beef to consumers. The Texas Beef Checkoff program, an industry marketing arm paid for by the cattle ranchers themselves, has funded a number of AgriLife studies.\n\nPatrick Stover, vice chancellor and dean of AgriLife and one of the authors on the Annals study, defended the NutriRECS-AgriLife financial connection. He recently convinced Johnston to move from Dalhousie to the nutrition program at Texas A&M, which included new funding for Johnston and NutriRECS. But Stover says the meat study work had been completed prior to this new funding.\n\nBeef, Stover says, represents a tiny fraction of research at AgriLife.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAgriLife has done $170 million in research in 2019, $4.5 million in beef, half of that from federal sources like the USDA, the other half from industry groups. That\u2019s a small part of our portfolio,\" he said. \u201cWe work very carefully to make sure there\u2019s no undue influence from any commodity group on this report.\u201d\n\nJohnson did not respond to questions about any beef industry connections but defended the study as providing critical information for people about the health consequences of eating meat. \u201cI hope you can focus on the bigger picture, including the science and what the public should know about red and processed meat, so that they can make their own decisions,\u201d he said via email. \u201cYou might also look at the intellectual and financial conflicts of our adversaries.\u201d\n\nBut critics argued the connection should have been disclosed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOf course that institution [AgriLife] is tightly tied with the cattle industry,\u201d says Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and a staunch critic of the NutriRECS meat study. \u201cIt is inconceivable that Stover\u2019s involvement in this project was by chance or because Stover had expertise in this area. ... There were clearly huge conflicts of interest that readers should have known about.\u201d\n\nThe Annals of Internal Medicine says it requires authors to \u201cdisclose all active and inactive financial and intellectual interests related to health care,\" though Christine Laine, editor in chief, declined to say whether the NutriRECS\u2019 partnership with AgriLife should have been disclosed. She said that if there was a funding source for this study that was not reported, the journal would have to publish a correction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any relationship between AgriLife and NutriRECS,\u201d she said. \"Would we retract the paper? No. A lot of the drug trials have industry funding. Conflicts of interest is just one potential source of bias.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther concerns have been raised about the study since its publication Sept. 30.\n\nLast week, the New York Times published a story that revealed Johnston had not disclosed a conflict of interest on a similar study in 2016 in the Annals of Internal Medicine that aimed to debunk sugar consumption\u2019s association with health risks. The study had been paid for by the International Life Sciences Institute, which has been financially supported by companies such as McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cargill.\n\n\u201cThat money was from 2015 so it was outside of the three year period for disclosing competing interests,\u201d Johnston told Times. \u201cI have no relationship with them whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd besides, he said, that has no bearing on a red meat study.\n\nCommodity checkoff programs are responsible for familiar ad campaigns such as \u201cGot milk?\u201d or \u201cPork, the other white meat.\u201d Collecting $750 million a year from producers to research and promote products, they are overseen by the USDA. These programs are, by law, not permitted to try to influence federal policy. But some experts see that risk in the new meat study, whose title is \u201cUnprocessed Red Meat and Processed Meat Consumption: Dietary Guideline Recommendations.\"\n\nAD\n\nDavid Katz, the founding director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale, said the study seems designed to influence the 2020 Dietary Guidelines. Katz says the study is trying to cast doubt on a growing body of negative research on red and processed meat.\n\nAD\n\nKatz says the Annals of Internal Medicine has always represented the highest standards of medical ethics. And while he doesn\u2019t believe the NutriRECS authors are \u201cserving some Big Ag master, they are looking for attention. This is about weaponizing science so it blows up understanding rather than advancing it.\u201d\n\nOne of the study\u2019s other authors, Regina El Dib, is an assistant professor at the Institute of Science and Technology, Estadual Paulista University in Brazil. She has received a S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation scholarship and funding from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, institutions supported by JBS S.A., a Brazilian company that is the largest meat processing firm in the world. Brazil is the world\u2019s largest beef exporter, providing 20 percent of total global beef exports.\n\nAD\n\nReached via email, El Dib said that there is no financial or intellectual conflict of interest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cS\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation is also a governmental organization that helps many professors\/researchers with their professional scientific career and to conduct their research. I received FAPESP money to spend six months as a visiting professor at Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada last year, mainly, to assist in the development of the systematic review of randomized control trials of red meat.\u201d\n\nWhether these funding sources should have been disclosed is a source of debate in the nutrition field.\n\nJohn Sievenpiper, an associate professor in the department of nutrition science at the University of Toronto and one of the authors on a study included as part of the broader Annals paper, says there\u2019s a lot of grey area in the interpretation of conflicts of interest. He signed a letter with a larger group of authors that called for the work to be held pending further review, disagreeing with the conclusions and guidelines piece of it.\n\n\u201cIndustry funding can pose significant issues that cloud the objectivity of findings,\u201d says David Goldman, chief science advisor for a new documentary called The Game Changers. \u201cWhile it would be unreasonable to suggest that industry-funded research shouldn\u2019t be allowed, it\u2019s absolutely critical that there be full transparency about this funding and any related conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nAD","123":"In \u201cMister America,\u201d a mockumentary that debuted last week on video on-demand, Heidecker plays \u201chimself\u201d on a quest to unseat San Bernardino District Attorney Vincent Rosetti, the man who prosecuted the case against him.

(Maddie McGarvey\/For The Washington Post)\n\nPaul Farrell, Jr. was looking through the West Virginia Code a few years ago when he came across a statute saying a county has the legal right to abate a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d Typically, that would mean things like trash heaps in someone\u2019s front yard.\n\nBut Farrell decided it might also describe prescription opioids.\n\nFarrell is a small-city lawyer in a place often described as the epicenter of the opioid crisis. His hometown has been flooded by pills \u2014 \u201ca tsunami,\u201d he says. A thousand people have died of drug overdoses here in less than two decades.\n\nSo Farrell, 47, made a federal case out of the catastrophe. He\u2019s now one of three lead attorneys in the national prescription opioid litigation, the biggest and most complicated civil case in U.S. history.\n\nThe first courtroom showdown is set to begin next week in federal court in Cleveland. Farrell won\u2019t argue the case before the jury. Instead, he\u2019s one of the backstage masterminds of the litigation, which now includes more than 2,600 communities. The plaintiffs argue that the nation\u2019s biggest drug companies \u2014 manufacturers, distributors and retailers \u2014 recklessly peddled opioid painkillers and fueled a wave of addiction.\n\nThe public nuisance strategy he helped craft has the advantage of requiring abatement \u2014 meaning the drug companies could be required to pour billions of dollars into communities across the nation that have been devastated by the epidemic.\n\n\u201cThey broke it. So they need to fix it,\u201d Farrell said of the drug companies. \u201cI want them to stop killing people. I want mothers to stop giving birth to babies addicted to opium. I want my friends and my friends\u2019 children to stop overdosing. I want to stop going to funerals.\u201d\n\n[Follow The Post\u2019s investigation of the opioid epidemic]\n\nFarrell is built like a wrestler, and his head has a severe boot-camp buzz cut, which, combined with his blunt speech, adds extra punch to comments like \u201cI am on the war front\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to crucify the chain store dispensers.\u201d\n\nFarrell represents hundreds of municipalities, having aggressively signed up clients, including Cabell County, of which Huntington is the county seat. He and the other plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are working on a contingency fee basis, meaning they don\u2019t get paid anything if they lose in court.\n\nThat\u2019s been financially hard, Farrell said, and he\u2019s not sure exactly how he and his fellow litigators would ultimately be paid -- because there\u2019s never been a case quite like this. But in discussing the case, he tends to talk about his hometown. For him, this big lawsuit is personal.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is the shell of the former glory and beauty of the town I grew up with,\u201d Farrell said.\n\nA city's resilience\n\n\n\nMarcum Terrace, a Huntington public housing complex that has been the site of many overdoses. (Maddie McGarvey\/For The Washington Post)\n\nHuntington is intimately acquainted with tragedy. The mayor, Steve Williams, keeps a framed photograph on the wall of his office, directly behind his desk so that anyone speaking to him will see it. It\u2019s the 1970 Marshall University football team.\n\nOn Nov. 14 of that year, a chartered DC-9 airplane carrying the team home from an away game crashed into a hillside nearly a mile short of the Huntington airport runway. The pilots had misjudged their altitude, possibly due to instrumentation malfunction. All 75 people aboard \u2014 including players, coaches and many prominent citizens who were boosters of the local team \u2014 perished.\n\nThat remains the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. sports history. It also remains very much on the minds of the citizens of Huntington. In interviews, public officials often cite the crash when speaking about the city\u2019s resilience. They say they had to learn to hold up one another in hard times.\n\nOpioid pills became popular in the late 1990s, after the medical community embraced pain as the \u201cfifth vital sign\u201d and Purdue Pharma introduced its powerful, slow-release painkiller OxyContin, which the company marketed as less likely to be addictive or abused. People became addicted, and pills became street drugs. When the authorities cracked down, heroin came to town. Then came illicit fentanyl, which was cheaper, more powerful and even deadlier than heroin.\n\nFatal overdoses jumped dramatically starting early in this decade. At the peak year of the epidemic, in 2017, Cabell County \u2014 population 96,000 \u2014 experienced 203 fatal drug overdoses.\n\nLocal leaders are sensitive to Huntington\u2019s image. They point to progress in the past two years: Deaths are down, overdoses are down. A \u201charm reduction program\u201d based out of the health department distributes clean needles for intravenous drug users, along with naloxone to combat overdoses. The community has opened a walk-in clinic for people actively using drugs and seeking help. A new program offers residential treatment for women with children or who are pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer the epicenter of the epidemic. We are the city of solutions,\u201d says Lyn O\u2019Connell, who helps run a new division of addiction sciences at the Marshall University School of Medicine.\n\nFarrell and his allies in the big lawsuit envision the drug companies funneling money to places like Huntington over many decades to deal with addiction and recovery.\n\nThe Huntington police chief, Hank Dial, noted that violent crime has dropped 26 percent in the past year, and drug use is down. But there\u2019s a grim reason for that: So many drug users are dead now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hanging up a Mission Accomplished banner yet because we\u2019re still at war here,\u201d Dial said.\n\n'I choose to fight back'\n\n\n\nFarrell prepares to present the latest on the lawsuits to the country commission in Huntington. (Maddie McGarvey\/For The Washington Post)\n\nPaul Farrell Sr. is a county circuit court judge here. He says of his son, \u201cHe\u2019s playing in the big leagues now.\u201d Asked to describe his namesake, the judge says, \u201cAggressive. Smart. Focused. And the last two years of his life, this\u201d \u2014 the opioids litigation \u2014 \u201chas been all-consuming.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of Farrells here in Huntington. There\u2019s a Farrell Building downtown. Back in the 1990s and early 2000s the building was the headquarters of Farrell, Farrell & Farrell, a law firm run by Paul Sr., who had not yet been appointed to the bench, and his brothers Mike and Joe. Paul Jr., a graduate of Notre Dame and West Virginia University School of Law, decided to strike out on his own rather than be part of the family firm, because, he says, \u201cA whole bunch of Farrells had to die before I could be in charge.\u201d\n\nPaul Jr. is not without ambition. He even ran for president of the United States \u2014 sort of. In 2016, he paid $2,500 to have his name on the ballot for the Democratic primary in West Virginia. He said he couldn\u2019t support either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because of their position on coal.\n\n\u201cYou cannot shut down our coal mines, brag about it on the campaign trail and then expect me to vote for you,\u201d Farrell wrote in an op-ed explaining his quixotic candidacy. \u201cWin or lose, I choose to fight back.\u201d He got a respectable number of votes in coal country and boasts that he came close to the number that would have given him three delegates to the national convention.\n\nNow he\u2019s taken on something even more challenging than a presidential race. Among the uncertainties in recent weeks has been who, exactly, will wind up in court if and when the trial begins. Judge Polster has urged the parties to reach a settlement. Purdue Pharma has reached a tentative settlement with the federal court plaintiffs as well as a group of state attorneys general. Johnson & Johnson recently settled with the two Ohio counties that are part of the first bellwether case. The pharmacy companies were excluded from this trial track. Left standing are major drug distributors, including McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmeriSource Bergen.\n\nA second bellwether trial is planned, with Huntington and Cabell County as the plaintiffs. That\u2019s Farrell\u2019s trial, in a sense, because it\u2019ll be on his home turf \u2014 in the federal courthouse, a short walk from the Farrell Building and from the county courthouse where Judge Farrell has his chambers.\n\n\n\nThe courthouse in Huntington, where Paul Farrell Jr.\u2019s father, a judge, has his chambers. (Maddie McGarvey\/For The Washington Post)\n\nFarrell vows to make that second trial more down-to-earth than the first one. The first one will feature a lot of academic experts, he said. But when the trial comes to Huntington, he wants to call to the stand a string of doctors, nurses, police officers, paramedics, firefighters and other first responders.\n\nIt might never happen, though. The companies could settle.\n\nThere have been other attempts to derail the Cleveland trial. The attorney general of Ohio, Dave Yost, petitioned a federal appeals court to halt the trial, arguing that the states, not the municipalities, should have jurisdiction over the lawsuits and any subsequent distribution of money.\n\nYost\u2019s last-minute effort infuriated Farrell, who along with other attorneys has spent a couple of years amassing evidence and preparing for trial.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t call me off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis entire thing is no longer about the responsibility of the defendants, or even about the amount of money they\u2019re going to pay. The fight right now is who gets to control the money.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the appeals court ruled against Yost, and the Cleveland trial is a go.\n\nThe trial is near\n\nJudge Farrell \u2014 who still makes pancakes for his three sons every Sunday morning \u2014 said that 90 percent of the criminal cases he sees are related to drugs.\n\n\u201cDo you want your drugs, or the kids?\u201d he recalls asking mothers who are in his courtroom. And sometimes, he said, the answer is \u201cI want the drugs.\u201d\n\nThe fire chief, Jan Rader, who gained renown in the documentary \u201cHeroin(e),\u201d was also in the judge\u2019s office, along with Paul Jr. She described the compassion fatigue that has taken a toll on her first responders. They\u2019ve all gotten good at using naloxone to revive people who have overdosed. But they become jaded when they see the same people overdosing repeatedly.\n\n\u201cA firefighter is a hero. They\u2019re trained to make a situation better. They have the tools to put out a fire. They have the tools and the knowledge to cut somebody out of a car,\u201d Rader said. \u201cThey do not have the tools and knowledge to save somebody long-term who is suffering from substance use disorder.\u201d\n\nPaul Jr. told the story of a young woman who as a girl played sports with his kids. She\u2019d been on and off the drugs. Her grandfather called Farrell and said she was acting erratically again. Farrell called her and asked if she was using and she admitted it. \u201cWhen you\u2019re chasing the dragon as high as you go, the fall is just as great,\u201d he warned her.\n\nThe judge signed an order to have her committed, and she went to residential rehab, and the day she got out, a Sunday, she had dinner with her whole family.\n\n\u201cThe next morning Grandpa found her dead in the bathroom with a needle in her arm,\u201d Paul Jr. said.\n\nOn a recent night, he took a walk downtown. To Farrell\u2019s eyes many of the people on the streets had signs of addiction. It\u2019s nothing he could submit into evidence in a court of law, but it\u2019s obvious from the way people wander aimlessly, or squat on the sidewalk, or pace anxiously.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. Something\u2019s wrong here,\u201d Farrell said.\n\nAs he stood on a streetcorner, along came a skeletal man in ragged clothes. The lawyer decided to engage him.\n\n\u201cWhere you from? What brings you to town?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe thin man said he was from Detroit, here to see some friends. His voice was not much more than a croak. \u201cGonna get my band back together,\u201d the man said \u2014 and that same man would still be wandering downtown aimlessly the next day, alone, no band in sight.\n\nWhen Farrell went back to his darkened office, long after his law firm colleagues had gone home, he made a vow: \u201cI\u2019m going to fix what you just saw.\u201d\n\n\n\nA billboard in Huntington, where more than 1,000 people have died of opioid overdoses.

(Delil Souleiman\/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nPresident Trump isn\u2019t the first American leader to turn his back on foreign friends who were counting on U.S. assistance: President Dwight D. Eisenhower did it in Hungary in 1956; President John F. Kennedy in Cuba in 1961; and President Gerald Ford in South Vietnam in 1975. But no previous chief executive has ever sold out the United States\u2019 allies as nonchalantly and unnecessarily as Trump has done with the Syrian Kurds.\n\nAt least with Eisenhower, Kennedy and Ford, there was a good reason they failed to come to the aid of freedom fighters: Doing so would have embroiled the United States in costly conflicts. Trump and his apologists would like to pretend that\u2019s also the case today \u2014 that Trump pulled U.S. troops out of northern Syria to avoid a war with Turkey. But there is scant chance that Turkish troops would have invaded northern Syria if U.S. troops were standing in the way. That is why President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked Trump to move the U.S. forces \u2014 and Trump, for reasons that remain mysterious, obliged. (Trump himself admitted in 2015 that \u201cI have a little conflict of interest\u201d because of two Trump Towers in Istanbul.)\n\nThe consequences of the American pullout are proving to be every bit as catastrophic as most observers \u2014 and Trump\u2019s own aides \u2014 had feared. On \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said that ever since coming to office about two months ago, he had been urging the Turks not to invade Syria. \u201cWe cited all the reasons that are now playing out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest being the likely release of ISIS fighters from these camps and prisons, not just that we see a humanitarian crisis emerging.\u201d\n\nIf Esper cited those reasons to the Turks, he surely cited them to Trump as well. But the president wasn\u2019t listening, as usual. Now Kurds are being slaughtered, and Islamic State detainees are escaping. With chaos all around, Trump had no choice on Sunday but to order most U.S. troops to scuttle out of Syria in a humiliating defeat. Our forces are leaving so fast they could not take with them, as planned, some 60 \u201chigh value\u201d Islamic State detainees \u2014 i.e., some of the worst terrorists on the planet.\n\nThe Kurds, in turn, had no choice but to invite Syrian regime forces to come to their rescue, thereby handing a massive win not only to Bashar al-Assad but also to his backers in Moscow and Tehran. The one part of Syria that had been under the control of secular moderates \u2014 the Kurds are more progressive on women\u2019s rights than anyone in the region aside from the Israelis \u2014 is now being divided between the brutal forces of Assad and Erdogan.\n\nAfter the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the presidents at the time made somber statements to explain why they did not intervene militarily and to remonstrate over the losses suffered by freedom fighters. Eisenhower, for example, said that \u201cthe United States deplores the intervention of Soviet military forces\u201d and that \u201cthe heart of America goes out to the people of Hungary.\u201d\n\nTrump did not express any such concern for the Kurds who have been fighting at America\u2019s side against the Islamic State. Instead he took a break from golf to tweet: \u201cDo you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\u201d\n\nThat Trump thinks that Iraqi troops fought Kurds in Syria \u2014 rather than around the Iraqi city of Kirkuk \u2014 shows how little he knows about this region. That he is inviting one and all to fight the Kurds (\u201cLet them!\u201d) shows how little he cares about American security, American honor or American allies. That he is now maligning his victims by claiming with no evidence that the Kurds are deliberately releasing Islamic State prisoners to force U.S. intervention shows how cruel and dishonest he is.\n\nThe Republican members of Congress who are apoplectic (\u201cShameful disaster unfolding in Syria,\u201d tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming) have no one to blame but themselves. They are the ones who continue to support a president who has been unabashed in his love of dictators, his disdain for human rights and his willingness to betray anyone or anything to advance his own interests.\n\nMost of the time, the costs of the Trump presidency are inchoate \u2014 laws are broken, norms transgressed. But when it came to immigrant children in cages or Kurds in the line of fire, the costs are all too human and horrifying. Are you happy now, Trump supporters? Is all this worth a corporate tax cut?\n\nWatch:\n\nRead more:\n\nAsli Aydintasbas: The Turkish incursion is sowing the seeds of hatred for generations to come\n\nIlham Ahmed: We fought ISIS side by side with the Americans.

Lawmakers are focused on whether the president abused his office by leveraging diplomatic engagement, and possibly military aid, to secure investigations that would damage the Bidens.\n\nAs the top National Security Council official on Ukraine matters, Hill worked closely with two diplomats who have become central to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified last week about her understanding of Giuliani\u2019s efforts to remove her from her post. Giuliani and some of his allies in Ukraine saw Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, as a threat to their financial and political interests, she told lawmakers last week.\n\nHill also worked closely with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who in text messages obtained and later released by House Democrats appeared to defend Trump against the allegation that he was pursuing investigations in exchange for U.S. support to Ukraine.\n\nSondland is scheduled to appear before impeachment investigators Thursday and plans to say that the context of a text message insisting there was no quid pro quo in play was given to him directly by Trump in a phone call, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSondland plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment. \u201cIt\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters.\n\nHill served on the NSC as senior director for Russia and Europe from mid-2017 until the week before Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a July 25 phone call that sparked an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s report and is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. A transcript of the phone call shows that during the exchange, Trump asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor,\u201d requesting Ukrainian officials look into both a debunked conspiracy theory regarding Ukraine\u2019s interference the 2016 U.S. election as well as the energy company Burisma, which paid Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to sit on its board. The former vice president is a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHill will be the third high-ranking current or former diplomat that the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees will depose as part of their accelerating impeachment probe.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to block current and former officials from testifying, prompting lawmakers to issue subpoenas compelling their appearance. Hill is complying with a congressional subpoena and intends to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions, her lawyer said Monday. Yovanovitch also appeared last week pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nHill, who previously served on the National Intelligence Council during the George W. Bush administration, is known for being a vocal critic of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and an institutionalist \u2014 stances that put her at odds with Trump\u2019s embrace of Russia\u2019s resurgent role in the region and Giuliani\u2019s style of maneuvering in Ukraine.\n\nAD","127":"I\u2019m not sure whether it qualifies as comforting to realize, in nail-gnawing victory, that you\u2019re even closer to absolute misery than imagined. The Dolphins, who have traded away their best players over the past six weeks, aren\u2019t really trying to win. Consider them effortlessly terrible. The Redskins, on the other hand, exerted themselves quite a bit in losing their first five games. Consider them diligently terrible. It\u2019s hard to know which is better (or worse): To execute a cockamamie losing plan, or to stumble into hopelessness?\n\nDecide for yourself. But in a 17-16 victory Sunday, Washington survived the humiliation of falling to an opponent that probably would have shed tears during the postgame prayer circle if it had won. To end a week that started with the firing of Coach Jay Gruden, Washington improved to 1-5 in this lost season. Miami, which hadn\u2019t come within 20 points of victory in its previous four games, actually improved its record, too. At 0-5, it plods on a long journey toward clinching the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn February, Hard Rock Stadium will host Super Bowl LIV. So, clearly, this game was an odd form of pre-Super Bowl hazing. The Dolphins announced that 59,808 tickets were distributed Sunday, but 20,000 of those must have been thrown directly into trash cans. It was a bland atmosphere befitting two winless teams.\n\nFor the most part, the game lived down to expectations. The first six possessions resulted in punts. Washington gained just 311 yards, Miami just 271. But there were enough splashes of good football to keep it interesting. Washington rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin was spectacular again, finishing with 100 yards on four receptions. As fantastic as those stats were, his impact was greater. He scored two long touchdowns. If Washington had been able to finish the game properly on offense, his 32-yard reception with 3:59 remaining would have resonated as an even bigger play.\n\nBut after all the misfortune to start the 2019 season, the Redskins weren\u2019t going to win without some drama. They led 17-3 entering the fourth quarter, but Miami replaced ineffective and battered quarterback Josh Rosen with Ryan Fitzpatrick. And he turned into FitzMagic one more time, throwing for 132 yards in the final quarter and leading the Dolphins on two touchdown drives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Fitzgerald threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to DeVante Parker with six seconds remaining, Miami Coach Brian Flores didn\u2019t want to settle for a game-tying extra point. He went for two, and the play had no chance. Washington snuffed out a screen pass to Kenyan Drake, who dropped the ball. And just like that, it was over. The game had gone from awful to one-sided to thrilling, but thank heavens, it didn\u2019t advance to overtime.\n\nTo be fair, the tankin\u2019 Dolphins went for it when they realized they could win this game. They executed a fake punt. They tried an onside kick. Instead of extending the game, they went for the win at the end, which is a questionable decision to make at home, especially considering Miami had the momentum of a hot quarterback. It was also a merciful decision. There\u2019s only so much of this game that anyone \u2014 coaches included \u2014 should be subjected to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting when you have two winless teams,\u201d said Bill Callahan, the interim Washington head coach. \u201cEverybody pulls out all the stops.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf the two-point attempt, Flores said: \u201cWe were trying to win the game, pretty much. We talked about it. We felt good about the play. It\u2019s something we worked on all week.\u201d\n\nOn the Washington sideline, McLaurin remembered feeling confident when he saw Drake go in motion. The defense had been preparing all week for what the Dolphins do out of that formation. Safety Landon Collins, who had his best game so far in Washington, said the defense knew the Dolphins had only two options in that situation: throw to Parker or a screen to Drake. Even if Drake had caught the pass, he would have been stopped easily.\n\n\u201cA breath of fresh air,\u201d cornerback Josh Norman said of the win. \u201cWe\u2019re headed in the right direction. We have a long way to go, but it feels good to get that win.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe pessimist, or maybe even the realist, in you will declare that this accomplishment is merely one notch above the worst-case, cancel-the-season-right-now outcome. A loss to the Dolphins would have been devastating because, even as the team fell apart and fired Gruden, it still didn\u2019t believe it was irredeemable. During his clumsy and tone-deaf news conference last Monday, team president Bruce Allen lauded the team\u2019s young talent and made the instantly infamous remark, \u201cThe culture is actually damn good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDespite the results, the Redskins didn\u2019t think they were 0-5 bad. They\u2019re still not of the mind-set that they are 4-12 or worse. They\u2019re still on that \u201cwe are close\u201d vibe. It\u2019s foolish, but that is what they believe. So a loss Sunday \u2014 which would have triggered debates about whether 0-16 was possible \u2014 would have forced them to rethink everything. It might have ensured Callahan would have no chance of salvaging this season. Actually, when you lay it all out, perhaps a humiliating defeat would have been better for an organization burdened by disturbing levels of arrogance at the top.\n\nThey will have to settle for being almost a complete disaster. They are not the worst team in the NFL, but they are still the definitive second-worst squad right now.\n\nAD\n\nWhat a week for D.C. sports, huh? The Mystics won their first WNBA title. The Nationals are two wins from appearing in their first World Series. And the Redskins finally found a team more pitiful than they are.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not jumping for joy,\u201d defensive end Jonathan Allen said. \u201cWe won. We were supposed to win.\u201d\n\nThis Blooper Bowl presented a challenge to the notion of what Washington is \u201csupposed to\u201d do. Perhaps a proud player cannot find great joy in winning a game like this, but without question, there is relief.\n\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\n\nAD","128":"These afternoons in Meridian Hill Park are representative of the neighborhood, a community strengthened by cultural traditions. Residents are quick to point to diversity as one of their favorite aspects of the neighborhood. According to the latest census data, Ward 1, which consists mostly of Columbia Heights, has the largest Latino population within the city. The Latino heritage is evident throughout the neighborhood. Various corners have boxes for the Spanish-language newspaper, the Washington Hispanic. The Latin American Youth Center on Columbia Road NW is an after-school community center for neighborhood kids. The GALA Hispanic Theatre on 14th Street promotes Hispanic heritage through theater productions.\n\nAnthony Avery has lived in Columbia Heights for more than 14 years. For Avery, the neighborhood\u2019s inclusive culture is what makes it home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDifferent cultures are blending here,\u201d Avery said. \u201cThere is a multicultural aspect as well as LGBTQ acceptance. Those things are important to me.\u201d\n\nWhile Avery loves the acceptance he has found in Columbia Heights, he has watched the neighborhood change immensely since he moved there. He points to the constant construction of condos, the new, expensive restaurants and the closing of mom-and-pop shops as examples of how gentrification has affected Columbia Heights. Avery offers advice for potential residents about being able to afford to live there.\n\n\u201cGo look for a roommate,\u201d he said.\n\nCharlotte Schwartz moved into the neighborhood two months ago.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s gentrifying really fast, which sucks for the people who have lived here forever,\u201d she said.\n\nSchwartz, who comes from a small town, enjoys the perks of living in a developing urban area.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more going on here and a lot more people. And it\u2019s a very diverse neighborhood, which is pretty cool,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Columbia Heights, along with the nearby Shaw and U Street neighborhoods, became home to many of the city\u2019s middle-class black residents. Nightclubs, bars and theaters thrived in this part of the city. Jazz giant Duke Ellington lived in Columbia Heights.\n\nThen, in 1968, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and the riots that followed ravaged the city. Columbia Heights was one of the neighborhoods that bore some of the worst damage, as almost all of the businesses in the 14th Street corridor burned down. Residents fled into the suburbs and the neighborhood was left to rebuild.\n\nAD\n\nRebuilding was slow. It was not until the opening of the Columbia Heights Metro station in 1999 that the neighborhood started to recover in a substantial way. Since then, it has become a popular home for trendy restaurants such as Bad Saint on 11th Street. The tiny Filipino restaurant almost always has a line. Across the street from the Columbia Heights Metro station, retail developer DC USA opened a mall that includes a Target, Best Buy, and Bed Bath and Beyond.\n\nAD\n\nBut as the neighborhood has developed, crime has plagued its residents. One night last month, five people were shot, one fatally, on Columbia Road. A report by TV station WUSA9 found that violent crime was up nearly 60 percent year-to-date in the area surrounding the Columbia Road shooting and that nearly every month this year has been more violent than the three-year average for the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very tough year for our community, especially with gun violence,\u201d Christine Miller, advisory neighborhood commissioner for ANC 1A05, wrote in an email. \u201cMy work before I became a commissioner and during has focused a lot on how we are lifting up and supporting our youth as the ultimate violence prevention. . . . We recognize that there is a role for the police and enforcement, but as community leaders, I have emphasized the proactive solutions we have available through schools, social service providers, and the many local organizations doing the hard work to ensure area youth are connected to the community in meaningful ways, have choices and opportunities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLiving there: Columbia Heights\u2019 boundaries are 16th Street NW to the west, Sherman Avenue to the east, Spring Road to the north and Florida Avenue to the south.\n\nAD\n\nThere are 118 properties listed for sale in Columbia Heights. The most expensive is a three-bedroom, three-bathroom condo for $2.4 million. The least expensive is a rowhouse in need of substantial rehabilitation for $100,000. The average sales price of homes in Columbia Heights in 2018 was $617,441.\n\n\u201cThe bustling Columbia Heights neighborhood offers a wide variety of retail and dining options and a vibrant culture that together are otherwise difficult to find elsewhere in the city,\u201d Homaira Karimi, an agent with TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, wrote in an email. \u201cThat along with its relatively affordable pricing and central location makes it an ideal neighborhood for both first-time and repeat home buyers. In taking a look at the numbers, we\u2019re seeing that Columbia Heights continues to remain more affordable than the rest of Northwest D.C., with the average sales price being 28 percent lower.\u201d\n\nKarimi said the median time of a Columbia Heights home on the market is 14 days, and properties are selling for 99 percent of their asking price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Zillow.com, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,972.

(Whenever you read about gut bacteria or probiotics? That\u2019s Ghannoum\u2019s work.)\n\nGhannoum was in Washington for a scientific conference in 1990, and he was in trouble.\n\nHis country, Kuwait, had just been invaded by Saddam Hussein. His city was in scorched-earth ruin, and his young family was squatting in a dorm room in England while he tried to find work and a way to get them all to the United States.\n\nAD\n\nBut the people who could help him find work wouldn\u2019t be in the District until the next weekend. He had neither the money to stay there, nor the means to change his plane ticket.\n\nSo he ducked into a travel agency and told his story.\n\nThe travel agent in charge that day listened to this story from this Muslim man with a mustache, a thick accent and a brown suit.\n\nAD\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t turn him away.\n\nHe found a way for Ghannoum to be in D.C. the following weekend, with some keyboard clicks and a new plane ticket. And then he opened his wallet and gave him $80 cash. \u201cSo you have some spending money,\u201d he told him.\n\nGhannoum interviewed like a boss and got two job offers.\n\nAD\n\nHe told the story about America\u2019s open arms for 30 years as he wrote papers, made discoveries and became a force in American science.\n\nBut he also never got to thank the man.

Ghannoum didn\u2019t recognize the salt-and-pepper-bearded Dorsey of 2019, the man who had been fighting liver and lung cancer for a decade. They were both 39 on that travel agency day.\n\nSo Elaine sent the family older pictures of Dorsey, young and fit in Vietnam, with his postwar Afro and white suit in the 1970s, with his close-cropped hair and coach clothes in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s him,\u201d Ghannoum said. \u201cIt\u2019s him, 100 percent.

As they did in June, owners Johnny Monis and Anne Marler have put fine dining on hold for October to host a pop-up, Happy Gyro, Tuesday through Saturday through Nov. 2.\n\n[Tom Sietsema\u2019s 2019 fall dining guide]\n\nTranscendent is not too strong a word to describe the cavalcade of dishes that for some of us taste of pure nostalgia and also reflect the way the chef and his wife prefer to take food.\n\n\u201cWe eat mostly vegetables in real life, so Johnny has been messing around with a lot of food behind the scenes for a while now,\u201d Marler says of the chef in an email. \u201cIt just felt like fun to bring some of those ideas to life for a stint and show a different side of our personality. Kind of like dropping an EP or a single instead of a full album.\u201d\n\nBring. It. On. The first marvel is a tiny taco whose dark filling, hidden beneath shredded lettuce, is a ringer for ground beef. Playing the meaty role, however: ground black walnuts imbued with a housemade version of Old El Paso taco seasoning. Close behind the treat is a souvlaki featuring mushrooms that have been sliced paper-thin, marinated, layered and pressed for a few days before they\u2019re threaded on a skewer and seasoned with oregano. Along for the joyride is a dreamy mustard dip.\n\n\n\nFig salad with Parker House rolls. (Scott Suchman\/For The Washington Post)\n\nA mini taco filled with ground black walnuts. (Scott Suchman\/For The Washington Post)\n\nIdeas for the meal are mostly nods to the carryout the chef\u2019s parents opened in the late 1970s. Other dishes seem to be taking advantage of the season. See: plump figs and watermelon cucumbers arranged atop whipped ricotta in a frame-worthy salad.\n\nThe grandest illusions are the gyro and the not-fish fillet.\n\n[After two decades as food critic, Tom Sietsema tracks the revolution in D.C. dining]\n\nThe former is a magic trick coaxed from tofu skin, griddled at different temperatures and times to achieve a gyro\u2019s signature crisp edges, then bundled in pillowy pita. Swear to God, the filling tastes just like meat. The latter could be served at McDonald\u2019s and no one would be the wiser. What could pass for fried fish is breaded tofu. As for its soft bun and melted cheese, \u201csome things are not worth messing with,\u201d says Marler. The fast-food flavor is accomplished with good old potato rolls and American cheese.\n\nFor the pop-up, both the staff and the space are dressed down. The night I caught their act, Marler and crew were suited as if for a bowling alley and several of Komi\u2019s tables had been replaced with furniture that would look right at home in a diner. I like it, I like it. And I really dig the finish, a three-bite sundae served in a tiny cup with a plastic spoon.\n\n\n\nThe mushroom \"souvlaki.\" (Scott Suchman\/For The Washington Post)\n\nWill the owners host another Happy Gyro? \u201cWe might bring it back in the future. We might not. We might do something else,\u201d says Marler. \u201cWe just want to keep having fun. That\u2019s pretty much our mission statement.\u201d\n\nCross your fingers, rub some fuzzy dice, seek out a four-leaf clover and hope Happy Gyro or \u201csomething else\u201d occurs again.

After Miami downed a punt at the Washington 1-yard line, the Redskins\u2019 offense found itself in the shadow of its own end zone with 4:41 left. McLaurin ran a post-corner route to get open for a 32-yard catch that moved the chains and provided valuable breathing room in a game Washington held on to win.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make up for the one I didn\u2019t have,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want as a receiver. You\u2019re not necessarily going to make them all, but I try to train my mind to really let things go when things don\u2019t necessarily go my way and be ready for the next play. It\u2019s humbling, because you come from having a great game to dropping a ball that could really continue our drive.\u201d\n\nMcLaurin added: \u201cI think [route running] is what separates good receivers from great receivers. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m great yet, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m striving to be.\u201d\n\nA third-round pick in April\u2019s draft, McLaurin has grown into the top offensive weapon on Washington\u2019s roster, and the Redskins fed him the ball Sunday. He had seven targets, three more than any teammate, finishing with four catches for 100 yards and two touchdowns. The first score was a 25-yarder in which McLaurin ran inside before breaking to the outside, leaving Miami defensive back Ken Webster chasing after him. The second touchdown was a 33-yard fade from the slot in which McLaurin simply ran away from the defender.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive the type of poise that he has,\u201d interim coach Bill Callahan said. \u201cThe [fourth-quarter reception] was an art-form piece of work.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 offense has had trouble producing big plays since last season, and McLaurin has been a pleasant surprise as a home run hitter. He has at least 50 yards receiving in every game he has played and a touchdown in all but one. For a team that is lacking high-end players on its roster, McLaurin has established himself as a building block at wide receiver.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s friendly on the eyes, as a quarterback,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cJust the body language he gives in and out of breaks. I know where he\u2019s going to be at all times.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRun game finds success, but quarterback play is still an issue\n\nCallahan swore that the Redskins would rededicate themselves to the run under his direction, and that\u2019s exactly what they did in his first game in charge. Running back Adrian Peterson got work early and often and came away with season highs in attempts (23) and yards (118). His 25-yarder in the second quarter was his longest run of the year and set up the first touchdown.\n\nAD\n\nThis is exactly what Callahan wants: more rushing attempts than the opponent. Washington had 33 rushes compared to Miami\u2019s 21.\n\n\u201cI was happy for [Peterson] to see that we could get him going and get him in a rhythm,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cYou see the competitive nature of him. He would take the ball every down if we gave it to him and he would produce.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut while the commitment to the running game is real, quarterback play remains an issue. Callahan said he saw enough from Keenum that he would continue being the starting quarterback moving forward, but the numbers weren\u2019t great. He finished 13 for 25 for 166 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions \u2014 although he came dangerously close to one on a play in which he scrambled in the second half. Keenum also continued to miss some open receivers, but the big throws he made to McLaurin were perfect.\n\nAD\n\nThe passing game probably will continue to be a work in progress, and some will continue to call for rookie Dwayne Haskins to start, but the success of the running game \u2014 albeit against a struggling Dolphins defense \u2014 offered some hope. If Washington can run the ball effectively and take advantage of some play-action fakes and one-on-one coverages, that could be a recipe for success.\n\nQuinton Dunbar is Washington\u2019s best cornerback\n\nAD\n\nJosh Norman gets more attention and the bigger paycheck, but Dunbar continues to prove he\u2019s the top cornerback on the Redskins\u2019 roster. He recorded an interception against Miami when he jumped a route in the second quarter, his third in four games played.\n\nThe defense visibly suffered over the past two years when he missed time with injuries, and opponents have tested Norman more than him.\n\n\u201cJust film breakdown,\u201d Dunbar said of his recent success. \u201cReading concepts. Me playing receiver [previously] helps me out a lot with concepts and stuff like that. That\u2019s pretty much it. \u2026 Now that I\u2019m four years, five years in, I slow the game down tremendously.\u201d\n\nAD","133":"\n\nPresident Trump walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn at the White House on Thursday. (Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump renewed his call to unmask the whistleblower whose complaint sparked an impeachment inquiry, and he took issue with a suggestion by a leading Democrat that the anonymous U.S. intelligence official may not be called to testify in person before Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, relayed in morning tweets, came as House investigators prepared to hear from Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser, about how the administration\u2019s Ukraine policies were influenced by the efforts of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to have the country investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nWith Congress returning to Washington after a two-week recess, several other depositions are also planned, including that of key figure Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who is scheduled to appear Thursday under subpoena.\n\nAhead of Hill\u2019s testimony, one GOP lawmaker decried the process as a \u201cclown show.\u201d\n\n\u25cf Rep. Adam B. Schiff hints that panel may not press whistleblower to testify in person.\n\n\u25cf Hunter Biden says he will resign from Chinese company board and won\u2019t take foreign work if his father is president.\n\n\u25cf Trump\u2019s envoy to testify that the contention of \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 came from Trump.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky |The letter from White House counsel to House leaders\n\n10:30 a.m.: Starr says impeachment inquiry \u2018doomed to fail\u2019\n\nDuring a Monday morning appearance on Fox News, former independent counsel Ken Starr said he doesn\u2019t believe Trump committed an impeachable offense \u2014 unlike former president Bill Clinton.\n\nStarr, whose investigation led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998, has been a vocal critic of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into Trump. In previous Fox News interviews, he said Trump had shown \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden but said nothing has risen to the level of being criminal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything close to an impeachable offense here,\u201d Starr said. He said Clinton, by contrast, \u201cclearly committed crimes, federal crimes.\u201d\n\nThe Trump impeachment inquiry, Starr added, \u201cis doomed to fail.\u201d\n\n9:50 a.m.: GOP lawmakers call for opening process\n\nAhead of Hill\u2019s closed-door deposition Monday, several Republican lawmakers decried the process, calling for the proceedings to be more transparent to the public.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, the Republicans argued that the depositions should be open and that the full transcripts of closed-doors sessions should be publicly released.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the American public should know about all of the facts,\u201d said Rep, Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.). \u201cWe want the American public to have all of the information they should have in real time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the process and the substance, there is so much that\u2019s so wrong on this entire clown show,\u201d he added.\n\nRep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) described the current proceedings as a \u201cpartisan star chamber\u201d and said Democrats are leaking \u201cselective things they want for their narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere else in America does that happen?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cWe want the transcripts released for all the American people so they can see with their own eyes the whole context of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n9:30 a.m.: Attacks against Schiff are escalating online\n\nHours after Trump mused online about whether the Democratic lawmaker leading the impeachment inquiry, Rep. Schiff, should be \u201carrested for treason,\u201d a 53-year-old mother of four in Wisconsin retweeted Trump\u2019s post to her few hundred followers and added her own take.\n\n\u201cSHIFTY SHIFF NEEDS TO BE HUNG,\u201d wrote Jean Spanbauer, a onetime supporter of President Barack Obama. She had adopted Trump\u2019s epithet for the California Democrat, slightly misspelling his name.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, my tweets are pretty passionate,\u201d Spanbauer, who uses a different name online, said in an interview, adding that she doesn\u2019t specifically wish anyone physical harm. \u201cIt hits very close to home for me. What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\u201d\n\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \u2014 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that threatens Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Isaac Stanley-Becker\n\n9:25 a.m.: Several document deadlines set this week\n\nIn addition to scheduling several depositions, House investigators have set deadlines this week for documents related to the impeachment inquiry for several people and government agencies. Some of those are all but certain to be ignored, given the White House\u2019s letter last week saying it would not cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nHouse Democrats have set Tuesday as the deadline for documents from Giuliani, Vice President Pence, the Department of Defense, and the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDuring an appearance Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said \u201cwe will do everything we can to comply\u201d with the subpoena for documents from his department, which focused on the withholding of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nWednesday is the deadline for Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the two Giuliani associates who were arrested last week on campaign finance charges. They have helped Giuliani with his investigation of the Bidens.\n\nFriday, meanwhile, is the deadline for documents from the White House and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Trump has said Perry asked him to make the July call to Zelensky, but Perry told reporters last week he did it so that the two could talk about energy issues.\n\n[Rick Perry has been subpoenaed. Will he comply?]\n\n9:05 a.m.: Hill arrives on the Hill for closed-door deposition\n\nHill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser, has arrived on Capitol Hill for a closed-door deposition with three House panels as part of the impeachment inquiry. Her interview is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.\n\nShe is appearing under subpoena.\n\n9 a.m.: White House says Trump not expected in public today\n\nThe White House has called a travel\/photo lid for the day, meaning reporters are not expected to see Trump in public on Monday.\n\nTrump has no public events scheduled on this Columbus Day holiday. He has already tweeted several times about impeachment, but apparently he will not be commenting in person about the proceedings before Tuesday.\n\n8 a.m.: Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser to testify in impeachment probe\n\nHill is expected to speak to House investigators behind closed doors Monday at 10 a.m. about how the administration\u2019s Ukraine policies were influenced by Giuliani\u2019s efforts to have the country investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\nHill served as the president\u2019s top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council from mid-2017 until the week before Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke in a July 25 phone call that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nA transcript of the phone call shows that during the exchange, Trump asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor,\u201d requesting Ukrainian officials look into a debunked conspiracy theory regarding the 2016 election and the energy company Burisma, which paid Hunter Biden to sit on its board.\n\nHill will be the third high-ranking current or former diplomat that the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees will depose as part of their accelerating impeachment probe.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian\n\n7 a.m.: ABC News says Hunter Biden interview will air on Tuesday\n\nABC News announced that it had interviewed Hunter Biden over the weekend at his Los Angeles home and said portions of the interview would begin airing Tuesday morning.\n\nTrump has been relentless in making unsubstantiated claims that Hunter Biden was involved in corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China and has made an issue of his recent public silence. Biden said through his lawyer Sunday that will step down from his position as a board director of a Chinese company this month and promised not to do any work for foreign firms if his father, Joe Biden, is elected president.\n\nThe former vice president has stood by his son and said he would be a part of his presidential campaign.\n\n6:45 a.m. Trump renews call to disclose whistleblower\u2019s identify\n\nTrump on Monday renewed his call to unmask the whistleblower and seized on comments by Schiff suggesting that House Democrats may not press the anonymous U.S. intelligence official to testify in person before Congress.\n\nIn morning tweets, Trump also continued to insist that the whistleblower did not accurately describe the phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when the United States had withheld military aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn fact, the whistleblower\u2019s account closely tracks a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nSchiff, who had originally suggested it was important for the whistleblower to provide closed-door testimony, backed off that stance during an appearance Sunday on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that we already have the call record, we don\u2019t need the whistleblower who wasn\u2019t on the call to tell us what took place during the call,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe have the best evidence of that.\u201d\n\nIn Monday tweets, Trump also renewed his complaint that Schiff offered an embellished version of the call with Zelensky during a recent hearing. Schiff said that he remarks were intended to be in part parody and that Trump should have recognized that.\n\n\u201cDemocrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Cheney says impeachment a factor in Turkish invasion\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 Republican in the House, on Monday argued that the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry was a factor in the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Cheney said that abandoning Kurdish fighters allied with the United States would have negative consequences but suggested Democrats were partly to blame for Trump\u2019s announcement that he wouldn\u2019t impede the Turkish invasion.\n\n\u201cI think that what we\u2019re seeing happen is going to have ramifications not just in the Middle East but around the world if our adversaries begin to sense weakness, if our adversaries begin to think we won\u2019t defend our allies, that we won\u2019t defend our interests, that\u2019s provocative,\u201d Cheney said.\n\n\u201cBut I also want to say that the impeachment proceedings that are going on and what the Democrats are doing themselves to try to weaken this president is part of this. There was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border, and I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage they\u2019re doing with the impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\n6 a.m.: The impeachment crisis shines a spotlight on Trump\u2019s state of mind\n\nHe was hectoring and imperious. He was domineering and defiant. And he was audacious and cavalier.\n\nIn the nearly three weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened an impeachment inquiry, President Trump has struck a posture of raw aggression. His visceral defenses of himself \u2014 at the most vulnerable point of his presidency \u2014 have shined a spotlight on Trump\u2019s state of mind.\n\nLike an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected \u2014 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \u2014 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker\n\n5 a.m.: Trump highlights Fox News host saying serial killers get more due process\n\nTrump on late Sunday quoted a Fox News host saying that serial killers get more due process than Trump is receiving during the impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cSerial killers get more Due Process than the Democrats give to the President of the United States,\u201d Trump tweeted, sharing a quote attributed to Mark Levin, host of \u201cThe Mark Levin Show.\u201d\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trump had urged his more than 65 million Twitter followers to watch Levin\u2019s broadcast Sunday night, calling it \u201ca big show tonight on the Democrat\u2019s Impeachment Scam.\u201d\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) took issue with Trump\u2019s later tweet, writing: \u201cQuote cited by @realDonaldTrump is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an impeachment investigation, the House acts like a grand jury.

In Ohio, officers fired blank shots during an active-shooter drill. In South Carolina, an officer dressed in black posed as an intruder on an unannounced drill. In Michigan, a school is spending $48 million on a renovation that includes curved hallways and hiding niches, in hopes of protecting students from a mass shooting. In Florida, a police officer arrested two 6-year-old students for misdemeanor battery. In Colorado, teachers received buckets and kitty litter for students to use as toilets in case of a prolonged school lockdown.\n\nMass shootings, meaning incidents with at least two deaths, in schools are horrifying. But it is highly unlikely that a child would ever witness one. Research indicates that some security measures brought in to make schools safer \u2014 like realistic shooter trainings \u2014 may be causing children more harm than good.\n\nIt is 10 times more likely that a student will die on the way to school.\n\nOur chances of dying in a fire are also much greater \u2014 1 in 1,500. But we don\u2019t overreact.\n\nMore children have died from lightning strikes than from mass shootings in schools in the past 20 years. Still, we don\u2019t obsess about them.\n\nExactly how common are school shootings?\n\nIn the two decades since Columbine, there have been 10 mass shootings in schools according to a recent analysis by James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University who has been studying school violence for several decades. In total, 81 people have been killed, 64 of them students. That\u2019s an average of four deaths per year, three of them students.\n\nEven one death is too many. But for perspective, 729 children committed suicide with a firearm in 2017, and 863 were victims of homicides by guns that year.\n\nSchool-age children killed by guns 729 suicides in 2017 863 homicides Average killed in school mass shootings each year since 1999 Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; average students killed since 1999 by James Alan Fox, Northeastern University.

But very few studies have looked into the efficiency of these drills. One of them concluded that the practice can be helpful to teach students basic safety procedures. But to the author of the study, Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor at the State University of New York at Oswego, there is no point in dramatizing the drills. \u201cAll that causes is fear,\u201d she said.\n\nRestaurants have 10 times as many homicides as schools. Why do we want to arm teachers and not wait staffs?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misunderstanding in where the dangers are,\u201d said Dewey G. Cornell, a psychologist and professor at the University of Virginia. \u201cKids are at far greater danger going to and from school, than they are in the classroom,\u201d he said. \u201cSchool counseling, academic support, that\u2019s gonna do far more to keep our communities safe.\u201d\n\nUnlike the United States, the other wealthy countries in the Group of Seven don\u2019t do lockdown drills and rarely have school shootings. What is the United States doing that is so different from them?\n\nGun deaths per 100,000 12 United States 10 8 6 4 Other G7 countries 2 0 25 50 75 100 Guns per 100 people Sources: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Global Burden of Disease Study 2016; Small Arms Survey, 2017.

Now they\u2019re steering the conversation on gun violence.\n\nSchool shootings are extraordinarily rare. Why is fear of them driving policy?\n\nPutting more cops in schools won\u2019t make schools safer, and it will likely inflict a lot of harm"}}
